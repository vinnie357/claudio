# Microservices Troubleshooting for TaskFlow

## Common Issues

### Service Communication Failures
**Problem**: TaskFlow services unable to communicate, affecting task synchronization
**Solution**: Check service discovery configuration, verify network policies, implement proper retry logic and circuit breakers

### Database Transaction Consistency
**Problem**: Task data inconsistencies across PostgreSQL and MongoDB services
**Solution**: Implement proper transaction boundaries, use eventual consistency patterns, add compensating transactions for failures

### WebSocket Connection Issues
**Problem**: Real-time task updates fail between services and mobile clients
**Solution**: Implement connection pooling, add WebSocket health checks, use message queuing for reliability

### Service Deployment Dependencies
**Problem**: Service startup order affects TaskFlow functionality
**Solution**: Implement proper health checks, use dependency management in orchestration, add graceful degradation patterns

### Performance Bottlenecks in Service Mesh
**Problem**: Latency increases as TaskFlow scales with more services
**Solution**: Optimize service-to-service communication, implement caching strategies, use load balancing and connection pooling

## Debug Strategies
- Use distributed tracing to follow requests across TaskFlow services
- Implement centralized logging aggregation for service correlation
- Monitor service health and performance metrics across the ecosystem
- Use service mesh observability tools for traffic analysis
- Test service isolation and failure scenarios in staging environments
