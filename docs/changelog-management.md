# Claudio Changelog Management

[← Back to Main Documentation](../CLAUDE.md)

## Purpose
This document provides the complete protocol for maintaining changelog documentation when working on the Claudio system. Use this to ensure proper tracking and documentation of all system changes and improvements.

## Overview

**IMPORTANT**: Always maintain the changelog when working on the Claudio system. This ensures complete traceability of the system's evolution and helps users understand what features are available and how they've developed over time.

## Changelog Protocol

### Daily Changelog Management

#### 1. Check Today's Date
Look for `changelog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` file for today's date.

**File Naming Convention:**
```
changelog/2025-08-09.md    # Example for August 9, 2025
changelog/2025-12-25.md    # Example for December 25, 2025
```

#### 2. File Existence Check
- **If File Exists**: Update the existing changelog with new changes, additions, or modifications
- **If File Doesn't Exist**: Create a new changelog file for today with the proper date format

#### 3. Update Frequency
Update the changelog for **ANY** changes to:
- **Agent Prompts** (`extended_context/` directory)
- **Commands** (`.claude/commands/` directory)
- **System Documentation** (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/` directory)
- **Project Structure** or organization changes
- **New Features** or capabilities added
- **Bug Fixes** and issue resolutions
- **User Experience Improvements**
- **Integration Enhancements**
- **Performance Optimizations**

## Changelog Structure

Each changelog entry should follow this standardized structure:

```markdown
# Changelog - [Month] [Day], [Year]

## Overview
Brief description of the day's work and main accomplishments

## [Section Name] (e.g., Agent Prompts, Commands, Documentation)
### [Specific Change/Addition]
- Detailed description of what was changed
- Why the change was made
- Impact on users or system functionality
- Any breaking changes or migration requirements

## Updates During Session
### [Real-time updates as work progresses]
- Live updates as changes are made
- Keep this section current throughout the working session
- Document incremental progress and discoveries

## Next Steps Identified
- Future improvements or features to implement
- Known issues that need addressing
- Enhancement opportunities discovered during work

## Technical Notes
- Implementation details for complex changes
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Performance implications
- Compatibility considerations
```

## Section Categories

### Agent Prompts
Changes to any files in `extended_context/` directory:
```markdown
## Agent Prompts

- Updated validation processes for new agent types
- Added extended context installation for command/agent analysis
- Impact: Claude SDK components now properly integrated in all workflows
```

## Example Update Process

### Step-by-Step Changelog Update

#### 1. Before Making Changes
```bash
# Check if today's changelog exists
ls changelog/2025-08-09.md

# If doesn't exist, create it with template
# If exists, open for updates
```

#### 2. During Work Session
Document changes as they happen:
```markdown
## Updates During Session
### 10:30 AM - Agent Integration
- Started integrating Claude SDK agents into install workflows
- Updated install_coordinator_agent.md to include specific component references

### 11:15 AM - Extended Context
- Added command-analysis and agent-analysis directories to system architecture
- Updated installation directory structures to include new contexts

### 2:45 PM - Validation Updates
- Enhanced install-validator to check for Claude SDK components
- Added specific file and directory validation for new agents
```

#### 3. After Completing Work
Finalize the changelog entry:
```markdown
## Summary
Successfully integrated Claude SDK components into all core Claudio workflows including install, upgrade, and validation processes.

## Next Steps Identified
- Update test/agent_validation.md to include Claude SDK components
- Refactor root CLAUDE.md to reduce verbosity and improve navigation
- Create comprehensive docs/ structure for detailed documentation
```

## Maintenance Best Practices

### Daily Practices
1. **Start Each Session**: Check for existing changelog or create new one
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Document changes as they happen
3. **Session Summary**: Summarize accomplishments at end of session
4. **Next Steps**: Record future work identified during session

### Quality Guidelines
- **Be Specific**: Include exact file names and changes made
- **Explain Why**: Document rationale for changes and decisions
- **User Impact**: Describe how changes affect system users
- **Technical Details**: Include implementation notes for complex changes

### Consistency Standards
- **Date Format**: Always use YYYY-MM-DD format for file names
- **Time Stamps**: Include time stamps for real-time updates
- **Section Structure**: Use consistent section headings and formatting
- **Cross-References**: Link to related files and documentation when relevant

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration
```bash
# After updating changelog
git add changelog/2025-08-09.md
git commit -m "Update changelog with Claude SDK integration work"
```

### Documentation Synchronization
- **Immediate Updates**: Update changelog immediately after making changes
- **Cross-Reference**: Link changelog entries to affected documentation
- **Version Correlation**: Ensure changelog aligns with system version changes
- **Release Notes**: Use changelog entries to generate release notes

### Team Coordination
- **Shared Understanding**: Changelog provides team visibility into changes
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains historical context for decisions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enables effective handoffs and collaboration
- **Training Resource**: New team members can understand system evolution

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Changelog Entries
**Problem**: Forgot to document changes during work session
**Solution**: 
1. Review git commit history for the day
2. Examine file modification timestamps
3. Reconstruct changes from memory and file diffs
4. Document retroactively with clear timestamps

### Incomplete Documentation
**Problem**: Changelog entry lacks detail or context
**Solution**:
1. Add technical details section with implementation notes
2. Include user impact assessment
3. Document rationale for design decisions
4. Add cross-references to related files and changes

### Conflicting Changes
**Problem**: Multiple contributors updating same changelog
**Solution**:
1. Use git merge strategies for changelog conflicts
2. Combine entries chronologically with contributor attribution
3. Maintain consistent formatting and structure
4. Review merged content for completeness and accuracy
