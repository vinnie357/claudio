# TaskFlow Productivity App Discovery Analysis

**Analysis Date**: 2024-02-28  
**Claudio Version**: 2.2.1  
**Project Version**: v2.3

## Technology Stack Identification

### Frontend Applications
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native with TypeScript for iOS and Android
- **Desktop Apps**: Electron-based cross-platform applications  
- **Web Application**: React.js Progressive Web App
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome and Firefox extensions

### Backend Infrastructure  
- **API Layer**: Node.js REST APIs with Express framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for documents
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live synchronization
- **AI Services**: Python-based ML services with basic TensorFlow

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub workflows
- **CI/CD**: Basic GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
- **Package Management**: npm for Node.js, pip for Python
- **Testing**: Jest for frontend, pytest for Python services

## Architecture Assessment

### Current Architecture (v2.3)
The TaskFlow application follows a monolithic API architecture with separate frontend applications. Real-time synchronization is handled through WebSocket connections, though conflicts occasionally occur.

### Key Components
1. **Monolithic API Server**: Single Node.js service handling all backend logic
2. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL primary with MongoDB for document storage
3. **Synchronization Engine**: WebSocket-based with basic conflict resolution
4. **Mobile Applications**: React Native with platform-specific optimizations
5. **AI Integration**: Basic machine learning for task completion estimation

## Development Workflow Analysis

### Current Practices
- Feature branch workflow with pull request reviews
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Manual deployment to staging environment
- Limited CI/CD automation for production deployments

### Areas for Improvement
- Microservices migration from monolithic architecture
- Enhanced AI/ML capabilities with advanced models
- Improved synchronization with event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive automated testing and deployment

## Legacy Issues Identified

This discovery analysis was created with Claudio v2.2.1 and contains several patterns that should be modernized:

1. **Agent References**: Uses old `discovery-orchestrator` naming instead of `discovery-agent`
2. **Prompt Structure**: Uses legacy `prompts/` directory instead of `extended_context/`
3. **Command Patterns**: References old subagent invocation patterns
4. **Documentation Format**: Uses older documentation structure and formatting

This analysis should be updated during upgrade to reflect current TaskFlow state and modern Claudio patterns.
