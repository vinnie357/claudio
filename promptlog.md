Each subagent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:


Copy
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the subagent should follow.

use these resources to create a custom /command named /gcms
git commit message short should, invoke a custom subagent that is responsible for comparing
the current git status, and suggesting a brief conventional commit message

use these resources to review the current newprompt command, after the analysis update the command and its related sub agents with the following:

a new prompt should now follow the command + sub agent pattern with its extended context stored in the prompts/<newpromptname> folder.
this pattern produces:
.claudio/commands/<newpromptname>.md - the command for invoking the task
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>.md - the sub agent invoked by the command
prompts/<newpromptname>/<newpromptname>.md - extended context made available to sub agent

when creating a new prompt if the new command can do parallel or asynchronous tasks it should create a cordinator sub agent for its work, that manages multiple sub agents to run the command in parallel or asynchronously. this becomes the command + coordinator + [n] sub agents pattern. 

this pattern produces:

.claudio/commands/<newpromptname>.md - the command for invoking the task
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>-coordinator.md - the sub agent invoked by the command, that invokes the requires parallel subagents
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>-sub-agent-1.md - sub agent invoked by the coordinator
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>-sub-agent-2.md - sub agent invoked by the coordinator
prompts/<newpromptname>/<newpromptname>.md - extended context made available to the relevant sub agent


 
# create the install command

use the /newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /install command 

/install  ( user | project | path )  default project

install claudio - runs the full workflow and includes installing commands and agents ONLY avaliable in project or path mode

install commands - only installs the commands, subagents, and related prompts available in all install types

the related prompts in user mode are placed in ~/.claude/agents/claudio/prompts/<prompt>
in all other modes the prompts are placed in <path | project>/.claudio/prompts/<prompt>

user:

install files to:
~/.claude/commands/claudio/<command>.md
~/.claude/agents/claudio/<command>.md
tell the user the session needs rights in ~/.claude

project:

eg: <project> - assumes current working directory

install files to:
 <project>/.claude/commands/claudio/<command>.md
<project>/.claude/agents/claudio/<command>.md
tell the user the session needs rights in <project>/.claude

path:

eg: /github/mycode/ or ./ - user specified path

install files to:
 <path>/.claude/commands/claudio/<command>.md
<path>/.claude/agents/claudio/<command>.md
tell the user the session needs rights in <path>/.claude

create a validation sub agent for the install, that checks for all relevant files after any install pattern is complete before showing the user a list of what was installed and where.

/install - defaults to project and full workflow

/install commands - defaults to project

/install commands user - installs to ~/ 

/install /path/to/code - runs full workflow and installs commands and agents

/install commands /path/to/code - installs commands only in the specified path


we need to ensure our commands know how to referecne their subagents correctly in folders, as well as their extended prompt context documents

when refrenced by a command the subagent can be called by claudio:<sub agent name> 
when a sub agent is refrencing the extended prompts they have to reference the prompts locations which depends on the install, they can be at <project>/.claudio/prompts/<prompt> or ~/.claude/agents/claudio/prompts<prompt>

review the git diff, for the commands that were changed, then ensure no extended detail was lost, if it was place it into each commands corresponding prompt documentation and make sure their sub agent is aware of the file, the most imporant aspects are the file structure and validation of file creation, and any ALLWAYS or NEVER instructions

the design command needs the same treatment

ensure the agents follow this pattern

any extended context from the original commands should be moved to their respective prompt location and addressible by the agent

during the process referneces to a generic subagent were created this is incorrect, every command using the command + agent pattern or the command + coordinator sub agent + (n)agents pattern should have its own dedicated subagent defined, and each of those should be able to refrence extended context in the respective prompts folder

# ensure agent access and prompt access

when installing commands, they need to refrence the sub agents in the claudio:<agent-name> format
when used directly they will just be <agent-name>

ensure all commands refrence real sub agents

unifi the location by making them all follow the .claude/claudio/<resource> format, this means moving the existing commands. to match these locations.

.claude/agents/claudio/<agent>
.claude/agents/claudio/prompts/<prompt>
.claude/commands/claudio/<command>


# review the git diff, for commands, and prompts

do a git diff on each command , and each prompt
ensure there is no missing context from the conversion, that should be present in the extended context.

ensure that the install command is using the new unified folder structure for commands prompts and sub agents, the project specific files like docs and tasks will still go to .claudio/

address 
  ⚠️ Minor Context Gaps Identified:

  1. PRD Command: Original command had specific PRD types (feature, enhancement, integration) that should be verified in the prompt
  2. Install Command: Already uses correct claudio:install-coordinator format

review the subagents .claude/agents/claudio/install-* ensure the have the new folder structure when creating agents or commands or prompts

check all the prompts and make sure they are named correctly, and make sure the process that makes new prompts makes the new 
names correctly

continue, this makes the format
.claude/agents/claudio/prompts/<prompt>/claude.md

ensure the newprompt command and agents use this new file naming and folder structure

# addtional verification

go one by one through each command, ensure there is a flow from command to agent or agents, and each agent should have access to an extended context in prompts

<!-- # propagation plan

each prompt folder, should contain a readme that would enable someone
to recreate the relevent command and sub agent. 
example file layout:
 prompts/<prompt> - extended detailed examples and instructions for the command and agents
 prompts/readme.md - documentation about the command and its agents to enable recreation -->


# implement command

use the /claudio:newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /claudio:implement command 
command to beging implementing the plan that was created by the claudio workflow
the implement should attempt to do tasks that can be completed in parallel with sub agents

the implement command should not automatically be part of the claudio workflow, users have to invoke it or pass an argument to 
add it to the  workflow



# upgrade command

use the /claudio:newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /claudio:upgrade command
command to take an existing claudio install, and upgrade it with the latest version
it should keep a changelog of the differences so a user can revert if needed without git
if there are no changes inform the user

# readme updates

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

the /claudio command is still using the old refrence the new one is /claudio:claudio

# readme updates x2

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

addtional workflows clarification, the tool is for discovery, planning, and implementation, discovery and planning are combined    │
│   in the default workflow, implementation is optional

# security review command

use the /claudio:newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /claudio:security-review command
command to do a security review with a stride methodology and product mermaid diagrams to illustrate the findings, by default this is used in the discovery phase of the claudio workflow
users can also invoke the command directly and target a /path/tocode or a "instruction" and the report will be generated for them. it should create any specialist subagents it needs and any addtional specific details in its prompt folder

the outputs should go to <target_project>/.claudio/docs/security/

when used in the claudio workflow the analysis should review any project documentation or .claudio/docs/ documentation or existing project code

# readme updates

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

# extend upgrade

review the claudio:upgrade command, it should by default run the process on the current working directory, but it should also
│   accept a path like /claudio:upgrade /path/to/mycode update the command and the readme to support this.

# test upgrade

/claudio:upgrade examples/web-app

 when installing, the created agents and commands are localized to the project based off of the discovery, never just copied over.  │
│   localization requires discovery outputs, so the new project specific commands and agents are tailored to the specific project.

update the command claudio:update and its agents to reflect this localization process

# test install

ensure the install process follows the same localization process and doesn't simply copy commands and agents

# update docs

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

when running the install in user mode to ~/
the commands and subagents are copied, and not localized, as there will be no project to discover. this allows the user to inital the localization workflow on a target project of their choice

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features


# better testing

create a test folder, with multiple example projects
one for each imporant workflow
one for install - tests the default claudio:install command that installs the entire localized system
one for upgrade - test the claudio:upgrade command that tests localized upgrade workflow
one for install commands only - tests the claudio:install workflow that only installs the localized commands and subagents
one for discovery - test the claudio:discovery command used directly

each test project folder will have a readme.md related to a sample project

each test project is a folder:
install - just a readme
install-commands - just a readme
upgrade - just a readme and an existing claudio install
discovery-readme - just a readme
discovery-code - a readme and sample code, can be basic elixir phoenix app no postgres

add a readme to test/readme.md that explains all these example project and thier purpose and which commands execute these tests.
sugguest an ordered script to run these tests that would run during continuious intergration testing
the readme should reflect that the example projects were all generated and are not live projects


review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features add a development section if not already present that makes reference to the test folder and its patterns 


# test upgrade command

/claudio:upgrade examples/web-app


# ci allow tool uses

review test/readme.md when in the ci workflow for the test script to not fail it needs to 
have the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag set for its test tasks

the ci test would need to be able to use the claude-sdk through claude  -p "/claudio:install" --dangerously-skip-permissions

the script should also check if claude is installed, and assumes the ci run or local run have an authenticated session with  
│   anthropic or an api token through environment varibles, in the github action it would use a github secret env


# research 12factorapps

/claudio:research software design https://12factor.net/

# discovery issues 

review the /claudio:claudio command, users are reporting that it is anaylyzing itself and not their projects

 /claudio:claudio /path/to/project IMPORTANT: ignore the claudio
directory its not part of the project, it is a tool to enhance the project, you don't need to discuss
this just run the workflow on the target project and install the commands, use the validation agent to
ensure the full workflow has run and the validation agent was successful.

the upgrade process does need to use the `claudio` directory and the `.claudio` directory to update the `.claudio` directory the   │
│   discovery process should only review the `.claudio` directory to see if there is an existing install and use it, the discovery     │
│   process should never use the `claudio` directory, as it is analyzing the target project not itself.

# validation loop not starting

users are also reporting the install coordinator is not calling the install validator when complete this should always be the installs last task

similarlly we want the claudio:claudio command coordinator to run its validation sub agent also

the the primary workflows are :
/claudio:claudio /path/to/project - run the workflow and validate
/claudio:install /path/to/project - run the workflow validate, install the commands and sub agents validate
/claudio:install commands - run the minimum discovery to create the localized commands then validate, then create the commands and subagents based on the discovery and validate


1. /claudio:claudio /path/to/project → run workflow → validate completion
2. /claudio:install /path/to/project → run workflow → validate workflow  → install → validate installation
3. /claudio:install commands → discovery → validate discovery docs → install commands only → validate installation

install commands, should always inlcude their required sub agents, and required extented contect documents in .claude/claudio/prompts

review each validation subagent, ensure they have explict success criteria and report what is missing

# test commands

/claudio:generate-test-commands - creates custom commands with their subagents and extended context in the users target project as /claudio:test and /claudio:test-g

each command, sub agent, and extenxted context, is generated using the context from the project discovery documents

/claudio:test - by default runs the users test suite, and provides a summary, if given a --fix flag it makes a plan to address the issues

/claudio:test-g - is a special agent that requires gemini-cli and gemini access, this command gives explict commands to gemini-cli through a bash tool use `gemini -y -p " {user input} + an explict prompt telling gemini it is in a read only mode, and is able to execute the projects test suite, use playwigh or other mcps where releveant and it ONLY responds in prompts to the claude sub agent that called it, it needs to provide a prompt of the issues found and a task list to address them ONLY, the claude sub agent will review the outputs by default and if the --fix flag is set attempt to fix them.

the generated test comamnds /claudio:test, /claudio:test-g 
are included in the 
/claudio:install /path/to/project
/claudio:upgrade /path/to/project
/claudio:install commands /path/to/project
/claudo:claudio /path/to/project

the /claudio:generate-test-commands command is used to generate the /claudo:test and /claudio:test-g commands that get installed 
upgraded or added to a project. the generate-test-commands command will not be installed upgrade or added to a users .claude directory ensure the validator and other subagents know this

the the /claudio:generate-test-commmands will be run, during a /claudio:install, /claudio:install commands, /claudio:claudio, and /claudio:update

# new command generator

create /claudio:new-command  - the new command generator expects a user to provide a name and a purpose, and either a research document or a URL example 

/claudio:new-command mycommand "does the thing I want" https://mything.information , or mything_readme.md 

if a URL is provided, the sub agent uses the /claudio:research command to generate the extended context files for the command

all new commands will follow our command structure of command, sub agent, extended context.
we can use this as a pattern, and includes validation

if the command needs to be added to the claudio workflow, they can add the --claudio "where it goes in the workflow" to their command like :

/claudio:new-command mycommand "does the thing I want" https://mything.information , or mything_readme.md --claudio "add to after the discovery workflow"

if the --claudio flag is not provided it is a user command and not part of the claudio workflow

#  update docs

this is incorrect, the agents must be their agent_name.md under .claude/agents/claudio/agent_name.md, and commands
  comamnd_name.md  under .claude/commands/claudio/command_name.md and the prompts prompt_name.md under
  .claude/agents/promopts/prompt_name.md  the validator should also check for this pattern.


# claude is confusing commands and agents

the folder seperation of agent vs command doesn't appear to be enough detail for claude, so we may need to rename the agents to
  include the word agent, so a command would be .claude/commands/claudio/command_name.md, and its corresponding agent would be
  .claude/agents/claudio/command_name_agent.md unless the agent name is distinct from the command name, this prevents the confusion
   for claude, when invoking commands vs invoking agents. we might also rename prompts to
  .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/extented_context_topic.md

  the agent rename plan is good, but we also need to review how agents are invoked the documentation shows "Use the code-reviewer    │
│   subagent to check my recent changes"  in ourcase this would be "Use the claudio:code-reviewer subagent to check my recent    
│   changes" this has no task or tool uses to accomplish it only that the agent is correctly formatted, and its description is   
│   relevant to the task, we must ensure our agent descriptions are sufficently detailed

this plan is good, we also need to address that extended_context/topics could have a folder structure like                   
│   extented_context/category/topic/{overview.md,troubleshooting.md}

the plan is good, step 5 can only be validated in a new session as the agents aren't loaded until a new session starts, so for     │
│   step5 suggest a prompt and write it to test/agent_validation.md so we can use this file in a new session to address what you were  │
│   trying to accomplish in this session

extend the description fields on each agent, they should reference any 


# claude-sdk-architect agent

 use the claude-sdk-architect to review the agent at ~/.claude/agents/claude-sdk-architect.md
   extend the subagent to spawn an agent focused on claude commands, and another focused on
  claude subagents these agents should be able to be used in paralell and they will be used to
   evaulate related commands and subagents in another claude system


 update our /claudio:newprompt command to always invoke parallel tool calls with prompt that   │
│   will always get the parallel workers going. “Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE  
│   message”.  we should update any agents or subagents that refrence subagents with this   
│   pattern


use the claudio-claude-sdk-architect agent to evaulate the newprompt command and its related  │
│   subagents

the new claudio-claude-sdk-arhitect is not spawning subagents which is causing its thread to  │
│   memory leak and crash can we understand why its not starting both of the sub agents?


 ensure any refrences to .claude/agents/claudio/prompts are now refrencing the           
│   .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/category/topic.md pattern

look for other examples of this failure, remember prompts are now extended_context

its no longer an agent prompt, its now the extended_context for that agent following the
│   pattern                                                                                 
│   .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/category/topic/{overview.md,troubleshooting.md}


ensure that subagents don't continuiously look for their extended_context documents if not
  found they should report that there isn't one, and offer to create one with the
  /claudio:research command

 an invokation of the /claudio:research command requires 3 inputs /claudio:research cataegory
   topic {URL or document}

ensure the agent is only reviewing one command at a time, and one agent at a time if there    │
│   are multiple subagents in the command, spawn multiple subagent alaysis tasks instead of one   │
│   trying to do them all

# test agent updates

 make a new test/claudio-agents with a simple sample web application and readme and update the     
│   test/agent_validation.md to use this when testing, rather than the root .claudio directory   

make it a sample elixir webapp instead     

update readme refrences for development to say this test workflow is invoked by starting a new claude     │

@test/agent_validation.md start the process from phase 5 where it failed last

what phases are remaining for the agent_validation test? 

continue running the test suite until its done  



we need to check the subagent invocation for these: 
new-command-generator
discovery_agent - needs to change to discovery-agent

we saw abritrary tool uses like `claude --agent` and `/new-command-generator`
and `Bash command cd /Users/vinnie/github/claudio && /claudio:claude-sdk --analyze-agent plan_agent ` in phase 7
 instead of the successful agent patterns used in previous phases

we also say the sdk agents invoked in multiple phases is this a duplication?
Phase 8 & 9 Tests: Command vs Agent Disambiguation + Claude SDK Analysis

the phase 8 and 9 test crashed, we need to review how its invoking the sdk agents this version is  broken.

---

each test/folder needs its own mise.toml and proper .gitignore

in the test/claudio-agents settings.local.json allow all tool uses for mix commands

the subagent invocations in tests/agent_validation.md work very successfully, check the claude commands in .claude/commands/ and the claude commands in .claude/commands/claudio/ and ensure these commands follow the same patterns for the multi subagent useage and parallel usage where possible

when the claudio workflow runs, or installs, or updates and localizes commands and agents for a target project we must ensure that the created claude commands and agents ALLWAYS follow these sucessful patterns

check all claude commands for the new pattern, .claude/commands .claude/commands/claudio/  also check any of  │
│   our commands or subagents that produce commands or agents to ALLWAYS use these patterns  

we need to do another check for any of the lowercase_underscore names, and make sure everything is lowercase-hypen

add the lowercase-hypen naming convention as an ALLWAYS to the root claude.md

# re run validation after changes

@test/agent_validation.md

# update documentation

review our current readme and any related documents in docs/ and ensure they follow the new repository patterns for the commands, subagents, and extended_context

update the root claude.md if needed

we need to put the subagent invocation pattern as an always do it this way in the root claude.md
"prompt that will always get the parallel workers going. `Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message`"

parallel task invocation is not always possible we should group workflows that can be, but some workflows     │
are prerequsites for the parallel workflows and must be sequential, when invoking parallel tasks we must use  │
this pattern:                                                                                           
"prompt that will always get the parallel workers going. `Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message`  │
we must also make sure the subagent calling commands pattern is in the root claude.md as an ALLWAYS use 
this pattern when subagents call commands and ensure this patter is used when creating new subagents or 
localiazing them   

update our change log

# review our commands to help

review claudio:claude-sdk command, look at the command hints section

we should add command hints to all of our current .claude/comamnds, .claude/commands/claudio

# upgrade leftovers

the upgrade command didn't clean up the last version it left behind prompts, and commands in the wrong 
  locations how might we check for claudio specific prompts and fix this? clean up some of the old patterns, 
  the prompts are now extended_context and the agents in 
folders are replaced by the ones in .claude/agents/claudio/, also clean up the commands in
.claude/commmands to be the onces in .claudio/commands/claudio
if the commands or subagents were not created by the claudio process leave them

here is a summary from the upgrade agents clean up in the other project
  Summary for the Claudio Update Agent:

  Cleanup Actions Performed:
  1. Removed old agent patterns: Deleted individual claudio-generated agent folders
  (discovery/, prd/, plan/, task/, documentation/, research/) that used the old
  prompts/claude.md pattern
  2. Consolidated commands: Removed duplicate command files, keeping only the claudio/
  namespace versions
  3. Preserved manual customizations: Kept custom Max platform commands (gcms.md, cq.md) and
  manual agents (claude-commands-analyst.md, claude-subagents-analyst.md)
  4. Validated structure: Confirmed all references work properly

  Final Clean Structure:
  .claude/
  ├── agents/
  │   ├── claude-commands-analyst.md (manual - preserved)
  │   ├── claude-subagents-analyst.md (manual - preserved)
  │   └── claudio/ (centralized claudio agents with extended_context)
  ├── commands/
  │   ├── cq.md (manual - preserved)
  │   ├── gcms.md (manual - preserved)
  │   └── claudio/ (all claudio namespace commands)
  ├── discovery.md (project analysis output)
  └── settings.local.json

  For Future Upgrades: This pattern should be standard - remove old claudio-generated
  individual agent/command folders while preserving manual customizations that don't follow
  the claudio namespace pattern.

  the cleanup agents should be part of the upgrade agent workflow

update any related documentation or values in the root claude.md

# claudio upgrade and claudio command fail to run validation agent

/claudio:upgrade /path/to/prokect
/claudio:claudio /path/to/project
claudio-coordinator-agent only ran the discovery creation, it failed to run any other tasks and related subagents, it must ALLWAYS run the validation subagent last, it kept incorrectly reporting success when the only document created was .claudio/discovery.md, it wasn't even in the .claudio/docs

the patterns should be similar to those in test/agent_validation.md
which does groups of parallel agents to complete the task faster

the process didn't produce an agent_validation_results.md this time why?   

address any issues found by the agent_validation test   

we are only interested in fixing issues related to subagent execution update the report generation to 
  reflect this



# research not writing documents

when used directly the research command is supposed to create the related research documents in the
  .claudio/research/<category>/<topic>/{overview.md,troubleshooting.md}

when used for a subagent the research command is supposed to create the related research documents in the
  .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/<category>/<topic>/{overview.md,troubleshooting.md}

correct this, as right now directly is just providing a research summary

create a new test/research folder, and a agent_research_test.md to run that targets this folder
it should work like agent_validation.md but only focus on the research workflows

test the updated research command @test/agent_research_test.md 

address any issues found from running the test

the extended_context documents under .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context are meant to support subagents 
  and their topics may only have overview.md files, the .claudio/research/ documents are meant to support 
  difficult patterns or tasks that requires our new format

# reduce fabrications and superfluous words

we need to instruct every single command and agent to NEVER fabricate information
NEVER fabricate timelines
NEVER fabricate security review contents
NEVER fabricate code quality
NEVER fabricate task status, if a task doesn't have a valid test it is not passing or complete
NEVER add superlatives to descriptions its wasting context

this should also be in our root claude.md

# specific test for /claudio:install test/install

review the test/agent_validtion.md

create a new test file claudio_install_test.md following the same patterns 
but only running the `/claudio:install test/install` claude command
it should also produce a claudio_install_validation_results.md

the test should focus on the install coordinator agent starting an running discovery, after discovery it should run the folder structure creation, and all the other agents in groups of parallel agents where possible including its own validation agent. once complete the test needs to run its own validation to ensure the correct folders, docuemnts, agents,commands exist   

we are testing the /claudio:install commands invokation of the the install-coordinator-agent and its invokation of all the install realted agents, and validting all processes have run and files exist 

do not track or deal with performance metrics we are only interested in the complete workflow running successfully

we no longer have a prompts folder, where did this come from? its extended_context now

the process also installs files to the .claude/ directory why is that not reflected?

the proces should also install files to a .claudio/ directory why is that not reflected?

review the install-validator agent, we need to understand why it is refrencing prompts and other invalid settings. it should be checking for our generated content in the new target folder under .claude/ .claudio/ folders, correct this before creating the test that uses it

lets also update our assumptions to reflect that `/claudio:install /path/to/project` runs the full workflow as users are making that assumption

the `/claudio:install commands /path/to/project` command is expected to run the discovery tasks, so it has enought information to generate just the localized claudio command set, this would install files to .claude/agents and .claude/commands which are the minimums it would not start the entire workflow that produces he .claudio/docs and other content

all workflows, should produce target project localized commands and agents based on the discovery tasks output so the minimum would be a .claudio/docs/discovery.md and all the localized .claude/ files

 the test failed its invoking the test incorrectly with a bash tool use, have it look at how the agent_validtion.md works [Pasted text #1 +9 lines]  

this approach of calling the install-coordinator-agent directly doesn't test our claude command, we need it to do that so if we need another agent for testing that mimics the commands execution of the other agents let us make that

this new test agent would be considered a claudio-system agent and not installed in a users project

update the validator, and the installer to not insall or check for claudio-system commands or agents in a users project

add a 'claudio-system' label to those commands rather than relying on a prefix

ensure the install agents and commands as well as the validator agents and commands are aware of these commands, the install command and agent is part of this, while the update/upgrade commands are not

yes this is correct, claudio-system labeled commands should only be avlaiable when running from the claudio directory, they should not be loaded into a users project as it adds confusion and clutter

this : 
- Execute actual /claudio:install commands using Bash tool 
 is incorrect as claude attempts to run `/claudio:install` and that only available in a claude interactive session. 
 it might have to be invoked as `claude -p "/claudio:install /path/to/project"`

 the command appeared to sucessfully be invoked, however it incorrecrly asserted that the install validation was complete saying the .claude and .claudio directories where complete when they actually had ls-la test/install

to better reflect their purpose

the install commands are failing in test since it is a nested session we need to add
--dangerously-skip-permissions to our command so it can run like this:
Bash(claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "/claudio:install commands test/install-commands")
THIS IS ONLY for these tests

the test is still falsely saying that the process completed with no files present
its also doing random changes on the tool use   ⎿  Bash(echo "/claudio:install test/install" | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -i)
we need to ensure the claudio-install-test agent only runs the provided command
also the validation must ensure it is running on the target project in our case it is
test/install, but a user can provided any path ensure this works correctly

⏺ The Claudio install test has revealed a critical failure in the /claudio:install command execution. The test
   results show:

  CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

  ❌ Complete Installation Failure:
  - Command reports "success" but creates zero directories
  - No .claude/ or .claudio/ structure created
  - Zero files installed (expected 50+ components)

  ❌ System Component Breakdown:
  - Install-coordinator-agent not executing properly
  - File system operations failing silently
  - Install workflow completely non-functional

  ❌ Validation Impossible:
  - No directory structure to validate
  - No localization to test
  - No integration to verify

  ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

  The /claudio:install command execution is fundamentally broken. Despite reporting success messages, the
  command performs no actual installation operations when executed in nested Claude Code sessions, even with
  --dangerously-skip-permissions.

  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

  1. Debug install command execution outside nested sessions
  2. Validate install-coordinator-agent is being invoked
  3. Test individual installer components separately
  4. Investigate permission/path resolution in nested contexts

  The install system requires immediate debugging and repair before it can be considered functional for user
  deployment.

 review the installer agents tools for example name: install-system-installerdescription: "Handles file copying and directory creation for Claudio system installations"tools: Write, Read, Bash, LS   --- why might theyn not be writing the files? 

suggest a prompt to continue this work

The Claudio install command system has been architecturally repaired with proper coordination, workflow
  generation, and implementation instructions, but there's a critical execution gap: agents report success
  while performing zero file operations.

  CURRENT STATUS:
  ✅ install-coordinator-agent: Fixed Task tool patterns and added workflow generation phases
  ✅ install-system-installer: Added complete implementation section with step-by-step tool usage
  ✅ Architecture: Proper mode detection, directory creation logic, workflow document installation
  ❌ EXECUTION GAP: Agents have correct instructions but don't execute actual file operations

  IMMEDIATE DEBUG TASK:
  Create a minimal, direct test to isolate the execution issue. Test the most basic file operation to
  determine if the problem is:
  1. Tool access/permissions
  2. Agent instruction interpretation
  3. Context/parameter passing
  4. Tool execution environment

  TEST APPROACH:
  Create a simple test agent or direct tool usage that:
  - Extracts target_path="test/install" 
  - Executes: mkdir -p "${target_path}/.claude/test"
  - Executes: echo "test content" > "${target_path}/.claude/test/test.md" 
  - Verifies: ls "${target_path}/.claude/test/"
  - Reports actual file system state vs reported state

  DEBUGGING QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
  - Do Bash tool commands actually execute or just simulate?
  - Does Write tool create actual files or just report creation?
  - Are there permission/path issues preventing file creation?
  - Is there a disconnect between agent context and file system operations?

  EXPECTED OUTCOME:
  Identify the specific point of failure in the agent → tool → file system chain and implement the final fix
  needed to make the install system fully functional.

  This prompt focuses on isolating the execution gap through systematic testing and provides clear debugging
  objectives to resolve the remaining issue.

write this prompt to test/test_plan.md so we can use it and continue to improve it  

│ > sugguest a prompt to load the test plan and address its issues, then update the plan as issues are resolved   │

  
  Please help me execute and improve our Claudio testing strategy by following this systematic approach:

  ## Phase 1: Load and Analyze Test Plan

  First, read our comprehensive testing plan:

  Use the Read tool to load: /Users/vinnie/github/claudio/test/test_plan.md

  Then analyze the current state and identify immediate issues that need resolution before we can execute the 
  full test suite.

  ## Phase 2: Address Identified Issues

  Based on the test plan analysis, systematically address any issues found:

  ### Missing Test Files
  If any test files are missing (like `claudio_claudio_test.md`), create them following the patterns and 
  requirements outlined in the test plan.

  ### Test File Updates
  Review and update existing test files to ensure they validate our enhanced architecture patterns:
  - Enhanced validation architecture (install-validation-coordinator + 5 specialists)
  - Dynamic extended_context creation (2-6 categories based on agents)
  - Index-aware validation using dependency mappings
  - Mode-specific validation criteria
  - Parallel execution patterns

  ### Architecture Alignment
  Ensure all test files properly validate the key patterns identified in the test plan.

  ## Phase 3: Execute Test Suite

  Once issues are resolved, execute the test sequence:

  1. **Commands-Only Test**: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p
  "@test/claudio_install_commands_test.md"`
  2. **Full Install Test**: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_install_test.md"`
  3. **Complete Analysis Test**: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_claudio_test.md"`
  4. **Upgrade Test**: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_upgrade_test.md"`

  ## Phase 4: Analyze Results and Update Plan

  After executing tests:

  1. **Document Results**: Record which tests passed/failed and why
  2. **Pattern Validation**: Check results against the pattern validation checklist in the test plan
  3. **Identify Gaps**: Note any architectural patterns not properly tested
  4. **Update Test Plan**: Modify `test/test_plan.md` based on findings

  ## Phase 5: Iterative Improvement

  For each issue discovered:

  1. **Fix the Issue**: Update system components or test files as needed
  2. **Retest**: Run specific failing tests to verify fixes
  3. **Update Plan**: Document the resolution in the test plan
  4. **Continue**: Move to next issue until all tests pass

  ## Expected Workflow

  This should result in:
  - ✅ All missing test files created
  - ✅ All existing test files updated for enhanced patterns
  - ✅ Complete test suite executable and passing
  - ✅ Test plan updated with lessons learned
  - ✅ Validation that our enhanced architecture works correctly

  ## Success Criteria

  The process is complete when:
  - All 4 core workflow tests exist and are aligned with enhanced patterns
  - Test suite executes successfully with proper pattern validation
  - Test plan reflects current system state and testing approach
  - Documentation provides clear guidance for future testing

  Please start with Phase 1 - load and analyze the test plan, then systematically work through addressing any
  issues you identify.

  This prompt will:

  1. Load the test plan and understand the comprehensive testing strategy
  2. Identify immediate issues (missing files, outdated patterns, etc.)
  3. Systematically resolve issues one by one
  4. Execute the test suite to validate our enhanced architecture
  5. Update the test plan based on real execution results
  6. Create an iterative improvement loop for ongoing testing quality

  The result will be a fully functional, validated testing system that demonstrates our enhanced validation
  architecture, dynamic extended_context creation, and parallel execution patterns are working correctly
  across all critical Claudio workflows.

the claudio test suite wasn't found becuase you didn't use the correct subagent header, look at the format    │
│   of .claudio/agents/claudio/claudio-install-test.md 

 change the test-suite invocation to " parallel workers going. “Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE 
  message”. "  so we can see each test subagent invoked together

# upgrade command 

an upgrade produced "[Pasted text #1 +24 lines]" which is a failure, the claude command `/claudio:upgrade /Users/vinnie/github/max` and properly invoked the upgrade-orchestrator-agent subagent. but the subagent tried to invoke the command that started it, this is incorrect, whe should see the upgrade-orchestrator-agent invoke each of its respective subagents in sub tasks, like the phased approach defined in @test/agent_validation.md , the only differnce is when a user runs /claudio:upgrade /path/to/project, it should start the upgrade-orchestrator-agent , and its sub agents. in the test senario user there isn't a user so the test file starts the process using the bash tool use of bash( claude -p  "/claudio:upgrade /path/to/code") think 



# install command
lets compare the current install-coordinator-agent with the one in the main branch, that one was 
  successfully installing the .claudio/ folder and its correct documents, but missing the .claude/ folder, 
  while our current one is printing a success message of everything we want, but not preforming any of the 
  actions the success messsage should be after the actions are performed and validated think
 
 we want the new parallel subtask execuition of the current version we just need those subagents to do their 
  respective work and not just return to the coordinator

our best example right now, is in test/agent_validation.md , this phased approach is launching all the 
  subagents in parallell, we want our coordinatior to keep the descriptions, but the subagents it calls in 
  subtasks should just do their work and report to the coordinator. think

rather than trying to do complex install tasks in a single subagent
lets have the install-coordinator-agent, select a subagent for, the standard install, and a different one for the commands only install, to simplify the subagents workflows
the install-coordinator-agent , will be provided arguments by the /claudio:install claude command
 
the most recent install command logs: "[Pasted text #1 +40 lines]" its clear that the 
install-coordinator-agent is validating the `claudio` directory and not the `/path/to/projet/` directory we must never use the `claudio` directory to validate, when the install command is invoked targeting a project it is responsible for `/path/to/project{.claudio,.claude}` never `claudio` as this is the source consider it a system tool in this context think 

review the upgrade-orchestrator-agent, and ensure it is also only working on validating the `claudio` 
  directory and not the `/path/to/projet/` directory we must never use the `claudio` directory to validate, 
  when the install command is invoked targeting a project it is responsible for 
  `/path/to/project{.claudio,.claude}` never `claudio` as this is the source consider it a system tool in this
   context think
# removed install coordinator
it was failing over and over so :

 have the /claudio:install command call the install-full-workflow-agent instead of the coordinator as that     │

# update-docs

create a new claudio system command /claudio:update-docs

one focused on making sure the root claude.md is up to date, 
and finally one to create or append to the change logs

# command and agent indexes

we need to track all of our commants and agents in their respective folders as an index.md for each,
these indexes will help the upgrade and install agents correctly use the agents and distringuish between
system commands and agents from user commands and agents --- think

# update commands
ensure all commands follow our new mutli agent and parallel invocation examples
start with /claudio:install and /caludio:update 
we want to ensure that all steps that can be parallel are executed together in groups 
--- think 

# command and agent types

we need to differentiate between system commands and agents, and user commands and agents.
when a user installs they should only get the claudio commands and agents that are not system ones by default.
system commnds and agents are for running the workflow, the commandas generated in a users project are for them

# install misses commands. and agents

reveiw the following agents:
install-agents-localizer-agent

install-extended-context-generator-agent
claude-md-generator-agent

compare them with the index.md for each type agent,command,extended_context

we need to understand why the claude command
/claudio:install test/install

did not install all the important localized commands and agents, we got a subset of the correct commands and agents

 the install process needs to ensure that the test-command-generator is run, so the project gets its localized test and test-g commands created. 

focus on fixing, the install logic, we will remove the test files and rerun after we have a fix --- think     │

 commands, and agents should never be a copy, they should always be localized to the target project --- think  │


#
# todo:
#

# flows
each test should adress one flow
a flow is defined by
a claude command used to start the process by the user
the claude command invokes a subagent, who can invoke addtional subagents depending on the task and in parallel where possible,
each subagent has access to extended context for their tasks they selectively load
each subagent can be augmented with user directions using steering documents that are named the same as the subagent that should load them, the agents will load any steering documents last before starting their work, this allows users to write their own steering without rewriting the system.

remove the 2. api handling its not a common issue. when possible take advatange of the pattern the            │
test-command-generator uses for localized-agent-generatoion and localized-command-generation, and             │
localized-extended-context-generation for the newly installed commands and agents, the extened context is     │
always after these, as it depends on them --- think 

 we want to keep the security-review command and its related agents, so user can audit their projects without  │
reinstalling claudio --- think, also test-command-generator can run at the same time as command and agent     │
generators, so localized-extended-context-generator runs last, to support the new test commands               │

 commands first, then agents, then extended_context and agents need to be aware that extened context might be  │
available --- think

claude-md-generator-agent
 when adding to an existing claude.md it needs to be brief, the current agent created a claude.md over 500 lines
 we should be able to summerize the locations of the claudio tools/commands/agents/extended context
 and the research command, and the new test commands in less than 500 lines. --- think
 
 this is better and more concise, but the claude.md is for claude not the user.
 so it should mention agents, and not command examples, if it wants to add command examples those would be a readme.md in .claudio/docs/readme.md we should create this if its not happening and split this task out the context in the claude.md is for claude and other prompts to use not a user --- think

 review the commands and agents in test/install 
 the install process has them referencing agents that don't exist, the process either needs to create them or not reference non existant ones, use the same index.md pattern for each type agent,command we use for claudio to address this during the installs --- think

the `/claudio:install test/install` command created these commands and subagents, during the localization-agents
we need to ensure when these agents are doing this work, they use the index.md pattern to ensure the referenced agents exist. our purpose is to correct this install process. --- think


do the same review on the `/claudio:upgrade test/upgrade` claude command --- think
 this plan failed, upgrade is a different process that needs an existing                                       │
│   /Users/vinnie/github/claudio/test/upgrade/.claude                                                             │
│         /Users/vinnie/github/claudio/test/upgrade/.claudio  use git to reset these folders, and check your      │
│   plan an install is not the same as an upgrade, an upgrade expects existing data --- think 
why did you use bash blocks? this isn't documentation these are lists of work to do, the existing upgrade     │
│   command worked we need to enhance it not break it   

do the same review on the `/claudio:claudio test/claudio` claude command --- think

# model diet

use hakiu where possible for subagent work
use opus where needed for research command
allow research command to think and deep think

prune sub agent context, rely on extended context files more, and sub section them into
general
troubleshooting
specific-topics


# claudini command

command for claude to use gemini for generic tasks with extended context

# test-g command

command for tests to use gemini-cli to run the tests, and claude to implement the fixes

# enhance parallel with worktrees

 Tip: Use git worktrees to run multiple Claude sessions in parallel. Learn more (https://docs.anthropic.com/s/claude-code-worktrees)

# checkout gpt-5 for planning tasks and command and subagent creation

similar to our gemini workflow that takes advatange of the large context window for research and debugging of gemini

the gpt-5 workflow appears to accell at project planing, requirements documents and prds.
