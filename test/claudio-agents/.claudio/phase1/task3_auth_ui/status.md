# Task 1.3 Status: Registration and Login UI

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 1.3
- **Task Name**: Registration and Login UI
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Authentication Foundation
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1.5 days
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Started**: [Waiting for Task 1 completion]
- **Last Updated**: [Initial status]
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Task 1 (User Schema) completion - needed for form structure
- **Beneficial**: Task 2 (Auth Context) completion - needed for full integration
- **Parallel Work**: Can begin UI structure after Task 1, integrate with Task 2 when ready

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] User registration form with email/password fields
- [ ] User login form with email/password fields
- [ ] Client-side and server-side form validation
- [ ] Error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Success feedback and redirects
- [ ] Password confirmation field for registration
- [ ] Form accessibility standards compliance
- [ ] Integration with existing app navigation

## Implementation Plan
### Phase A: UI Structure Setup (0.5 days)
- [ ] Create LiveView directory structure
- [ ] Set up basic registration form layout
- [ ] Set up basic login form layout
- [ ] Configure routing

### Phase B: Form Functionality (0.5 days)
- [ ] Implement form validation (client-side)
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Create form submission handling
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions

### Phase C: Integration and Polish (0.5 days)
- [ ] Integrate with authentication context functions
- [ ] Style forms to match existing app design
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and validation

## Technical Decisions
(To be documented as implementation progresses)

### UI Framework Decisions
- LiveView approach: TBD (full LiveView vs. traditional forms)
- Styling approach: TBD (follow existing TaskApp patterns)
- Validation strategy: TBD (real-time vs. on-submit)

## Current Work
**Status**: Can begin structure after Task 1 completion
**Preparation**: Can review existing app UI patterns and LiveView documentation

## UI/UX Notes
- Must maintain consistency with existing TaskApp design
- Consider user flow: registration → verification → first login
- Error messages should be helpful, not technical
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

## Issues and Blockers
- Need Task 1 completion for User schema reference
- Should coordinate with Task 2 for full functionality
- Must review existing app styling patterns

## Next Steps (after Task 1 completion)
1. Review existing TaskApp UI components and patterns
2. Set up LiveView directory structure  
3. Create basic form layouts matching app design
4. Implement form validation and error handling
5. Integration testing with authentication flows

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All form interactions tested and working
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] UI matches existing app design consistency
- [ ] Mobile responsive design validated
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Testing Strategy
- LiveView form interaction testing
- Client-side validation testing
- Server-side integration testing
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile/responsive design testing

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria met and:
- Forms integrate seamlessly with existing app navigation
- User experience flows are intuitive and error-free
- Design consistency maintained throughout
- All quality gates passed

## Dependencies for Next Tasks
Upon completion, enables:
- **Task 4**: Session Management (needs login/logout UI flows)
- **Phase 2**: Users can authenticate before accessing task features
- Complete user authentication experience
