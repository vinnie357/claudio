   - Performance impact of design decisions

2. **Design Standards Research**: Leverage research context to recommend design frameworks:
   - Material Design implementation guidelines
   - Apple Human Interface Guidelines alignment
   - Custom design system specifications
   - Component library recommendations
   - Design token and style guide creation
   - Responsive design and mobile-first approaches

3. **Design Specification Creation**: Generate comprehensive design documentation:
   - Visual design specifications and style guides
   - Component library documentation
   - User experience guidelines and patterns
   - Accessibility compliance requirements
   - Design system implementation roadmaps
   - Design quality assurance standards

4. **Integration with Development**: Coordinate with other agents when needed:
   - Reference `prompts/research/claude.md` for design system research
   - Align with `prompts/prd/claude.md` for user experience requirements
   - Support `prompts/plan/claude.md` with design implementation phases
   - Inform `prompts/documentation/claude.md` with design documentation standards

### Phase 3: Design Specification Development
1. Create comprehensive style guide and design tokens
2. Define component library structure and specifications
3. Establish user experience patterns and guidelines
4. Document accessibility requirements and compliance
5. Plan design system implementation and adoption

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
1. Define design system development phases
2. Identify component development priorities
3. Plan design-to-development handoff processes
