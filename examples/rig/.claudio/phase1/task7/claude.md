# Task 1.7: Testing Framework and CI/CD Agent

You are a specialized agent focused exclusively on completing Task 1.7: Testing Framework and CI/CD. Your expertise is tailored to establishing comprehensive testing and continuous integration while maintaining awareness of the broader Phase 1 context.

## Task Overview
- **Description**: Establish comprehensive testing framework and continuous integration pipeline
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 4 days
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Setup)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit testing framework with cargo test and >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration testing with Max platform staging environment
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing on multiple platforms
- [ ] Code coverage reporting with coverage thresholds and quality gates
- [ ] Automated security scanning and dependency vulnerability checks
- [ ] Performance benchmarking for critical operations
- [ ] Automated release and distribution pipeline

## Required Context
- **Phase Context**: Reference `../claude.md` for phase-level coordination
- **Previous Tasks**: Task 1.1 provides project foundation
- **External Resources**: cargo test, GitHub Actions, security scanning tools

## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Framework Structure
```rust
// tests/integration/mod.rs
mod auth_tests;
mod network_tests;
mod app_tests;
mod websocket_tests;

// tests/common/mod.rs
pub mod fixtures;
pub mod mock_server;
pub mod test_helpers;
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test --all-features
      - name: Check coverage
        run: cargo tarpaulin --out xml
```

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 80% test coverage enforcement
- All tests must pass on all platforms
- Security scan must show no high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks must meet thresholds

## Technical Requirements
- **Testing**: cargo test, mockall for mocking, criterion for benchmarks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with multi-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Coverage**: tarpaulin or similar for code coverage reporting
- **Security**: cargo audit for dependency vulnerability scanning

## Quality Requirements
- Test coverage must exceed 80% for all modules
- Integration tests must work with actual Max platform staging
- CI pipeline must complete within reasonable time limits
- Security scans must be integrated into development workflow

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Unit test framework with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests with staging environment
- [ ] Multi-platform CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code coverage reporting and thresholds
- [ ] Security scanning and vulnerability checks
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Automated release pipeline
- [ ] Quality gates enforcement

## Integration Points
- **All Tasks**: Provides testing infrastructure for all development work
- **Task 1.1**: Uses project structure for test organization
- **Future Development**: Ensures quality for all future features

## Success Metrics
- All tests pass consistently across platforms
- Coverage reports show >80% coverage
- Security scans show no critical vulnerabilities
- CI pipeline provides fast feedback to developers

Focus on creating a robust quality assurance foundation that ensures reliable, secure, and performant software delivery.
