# User Authentication PRD - TaskApp

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Transform the TaskApp from a single-user demonstration application into a multi-user task management system with secure user authentication, enabling personalized task management and collaborative workflows while maintaining the existing high-quality Phoenix LiveView architecture.

### Key Objectives
1. **Security First**: Implement robust user authentication using Phoenix's proven phx_gen_auth generator
2. **Seamless Integration**: Integrate authentication without disrupting the existing LiveView real-time capabilities
3. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive signup, login, and account management workflows
4. **Data Isolation**: Ensure users can only access and manage their own tasks
5. **Scalability Foundation**: Establish architecture patterns for future multi-user features

### Success Definition
- Users can securely create accounts and authenticate
- All existing task management functionality works within user-specific contexts
- Authentication integrates seamlessly with LiveView real-time updates
- Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation
- Performance remains consistent with current benchmarks (<10ms task operations)

### Timeline Overview
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Core authentication implementation with phx_gen_auth
- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: User-scoped task management and data migration
- **Phase 3 (Week 5-6)**: UI/UX refinement and comprehensive testing
- **Phase 4 (Week 7-8)**: Production readiness and security hardening

## Project Context

### Current State
The TaskApp is a sophisticated Phoenix LiveView application demonstrating modern Elixir development practices with:

**Architecture Strengths**:
- Phoenix 1.7.10 with LiveView 0.20.2 for real-time UI
- GenServer-based in-memory state management
- Comprehensive testing strategy (>80% coverage target)
- Modern development workflow with CI/CD
- Excellent separation of concerns and domain boundaries
- Production-ready code quality with static analysis tools

**Current Limitations**:
- Single-user application with no authentication
- Tasks are shared across all sessions
- No data persistence across application restarts
- No user-specific access controls
- Limited scalability for multi-user scenarios

### Problem Statement
The current TaskApp architecture prevents multiple users from using the system simultaneously without interfering with each other's tasks. Key challenges include:

1. **Security Gap**: No authentication mechanism to identify or authorize users
2. **Data Isolation**: All users share the same task pool in memory
3. **User Experience**: No personalized task management experience
4. **Scalability Limitation**: Cannot support multiple organizations or teams
5. **Audit Trail**: No user attribution for task operations

### Solution Overview
Implement Phoenix's phx_gen_auth authentication system to provide:

- **Secure Authentication**: Email/password authentication with password hashing
- **User Management**: Account creation, login, logout, and password reset
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with LiveView integration
- **Task Scoping**: User-specific task isolation in GenServer state
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control foundation
- **Migration Path**: Smooth transition from current architecture to user-scoped system

### Business Impact
**Immediate Benefits**:
- Enable multi-user deployment scenarios
- Provide foundation for SaaS or team-based offerings
- Demonstrate production-ready authentication patterns
- Increase system security and data privacy

**Long-term Value**:
