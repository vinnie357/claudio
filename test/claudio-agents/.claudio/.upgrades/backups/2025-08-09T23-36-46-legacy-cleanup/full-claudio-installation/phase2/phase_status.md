### Not Started ‚è∏
- **Task 1: User-Task Database Association**: Depends on Phase 1 completion
- **Task 2: Access Control Implementation**: Depends on Task 1 completion
- **Task 3: Controller and View Updates**: Depends on Tasks 1 and 2 completion

## Issues and Blockers
- **Phase 1 Dependency**: Cannot begin until authentication foundation is complete
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks must be completed in order for proper integration

## Dependencies
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Authentication system fully functional
- **Existing Task System**: Current task management must be preserved
- **Database Migration**: Need ability to modify existing task schema

## Next Steps (after Phase 1 completion)
1. Review completed authentication system
2. Plan database schema modifications for user-task association
3. Begin Task 1 (User-Task Database Association)
4. Coordinate with Phase 1 team for smooth handoff

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All tasks associated with authenticated users
- [ ] Unauthorized access properly blocked
- [ ] Existing task functionality preserved
- [ ] Task operations require authentication
- [ ] User can only access their own tasks
- [ ] Authorization consistently enforced
- [ ] Integration testing successful

## Integration Challenges
- Maintaining compatibility with existing task system
- Ensuring all existing task functionality continues to work
- Adding authentication requirements without breaking existing UI
- Database migration without data loss

## Success Metrics
- Zero regression in existing task functionality
- Complete user-task ownership enforcement
- All authorization tests passing
- Seamless user experience transition
