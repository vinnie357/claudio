# Claudio Complete Analysis Workflow Test

This file contains validation prompts to test the `/claudio:claudio` command orchestration workflow in a new Claude Code session.

## Purpose

Validate that:
1. **Claudio Coordinator Orchestration**: The claudio-coordinator-agent properly manages the complete analysis workflow with 15+ subagents in parallel batches
2. **Parallel Batch Execution**: Analysis system successfully executes parallel coordination patterns across 7 phases for optimal performance
3. **Enhanced Validation Integration**: All analysis phases use enhanced validation architecture with install-validation-coordinator
4. **Dynamic Extended Context**: Extended context categories are created dynamically based on agents used (not fixed comprehensive set)
5. **Complex Workflow Coordination**: All phases execute correctly with proper dependency management and error isolation
6. **Quality Validation**: Mandatory workflow quality validation ensures all documents meet enhanced standards

## Sample Application

The validation tests use the DataFlow analytics platform located in `test/claudio-agents/`. This application provides:

- **Technology Stack**: Elixir/Phoenix, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Machine Learning pipelines
- **Architecture**: Real-time data processing with Phoenix LiveView, GenServer workers, distributed task processing
- **Features**: DataFlow real-time analytics platform with ML-powered insights, streaming data processing, and interactive dashboards
- **Infrastructure**: High-availability distributed deployment with Kubernetes, monitoring, and auto-scaling
- **Development Priorities**: Real-time performance optimization, ML pipeline enhancement, and scalability improvements
- **Complexity**: Advanced analytics platform requiring comprehensive analysis across data engineering, ML, and real-time systems

This complex analytics platform allows thorough testing of the complete Claudio analysis workflow across advanced architecture analysis, real-time system development, ML pipeline coordination, and distributed system management.

- Retest specific failing phases before complete revalidation

## Notes for Implementation

This validation should be run in a **new Claude Code session** after any changes to the claudio-coordinator-agent or related analysis components, as agents are only loaded at session start.

The test focuses on **complete analysis orchestration with parallel batch execution and enhanced validation integration** rather than individual subagent functionality, ensuring the entire analysis system works as an integrated, high-performance process with comprehensive quality assurance and dynamic optimization.
