## Technical Stack and Standards
### Backend Technologies
- **Runtime**: Deno.js (latest stable, 1.40+)
- **HTTP Server**: Deno native HTTP server
- **Data Storage**: JSON file-based with atomic operations
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- **Validation**: Input sanitization and type checking

### Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with ES2020+ features
- **Styling**: CSS Grid/Flexbox with CSS Custom Properties
- **Architecture**: Component-based with reactive state management
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance preparation

### Development Tools
- **Testing**: Deno built-in test runner
- **Linting**: Deno integrated linter
- **Formatting**: Deno integrated formatter
- **Version Control**: Git with structured commit messages

## Performance Requirements
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **API Response**: < 50ms for CRUD operations
- **Interaction Response**: < 100ms for UI interactions
- **Bundle Size**: < 100KB total (stretch goal for Phase 1)
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient DOM manipulation and state management

## Quality Standards
### Code Quality
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Comprehensive error handling at all levels
- Consistent code formatting using Deno formatter
- Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Modular, reusable component architecture

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all utility functions and data operations
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Basic frontend component testing
- Error condition testing and edge cases
- Performance benchmarking and validation

### Documentation Standards
- Code comments for complex logic and business rules
- API documentation with request/response examples
- Setup instructions for development environment
- Architecture decisions and design rationale

## Cross-Task Communication
### Shared Resources
Reference `../shared/standards/claude.md` for:
- Code style and formatting guidelines
- Error handling patterns
- API design conventions
- Component architecture standards

Reference `../shared/utilities/claude.md` for:
- Common utility functions
- Shared type definitions
- Testing utilities and helpers
- Development workflow tools

### Task Dependencies
**Critical Path**: 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 (server and API foundation)
**Parallel Development**: Tasks 1.5-1.10 can begin once API is stable
**Integration Point**: Task 1.11 requires completion of all UI tasks
**Validation Point**: Task 1.12 validates all completed functionality

## Risk Management
### High-Risk Areas
1. **Performance Requirements**: Meeting 2-second load time without framework optimization
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring reliable JSON file operations with corruption prevention
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Vanilla JavaScript compatibility across browsers

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance**: Implement early performance monitoring, profile bottlenecks, optimize critical path
2. **Data Reliability**: Implement atomic writes, backup mechanisms, comprehensive error handling
3. **Compatibility**: Test on multiple browsers early, use progressive enhancement approach

### Contingency Plans
- **Performance Issues**: Implement lazy loading, consider lightweight bundling
- **Data Problems**: Fallback to localStorage, implement recovery mechanisms
- **Browser Issues**: Progressive enhancement with fallbacks for advanced features
