# Phase 1: Foundation Setup Tasks

## Task 1.1: Theme State Management
**ID**: 1.1  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Type**: Development  

### Description
Implement LiveView socket assigns and event handling to manage theme state (`light`, `dark`, `auto`) throughout the application. This includes adding theme state to the socket assigns, creating event handlers for theme changes, and ensuring proper state propagation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Theme state stored in LiveView socket assigns (`:theme`)
- [ ] `handle_event/3` functions handle theme change events
- [ ] Theme state defaults to `"auto"` on initial mount
- [ ] System preference detection implemented using JavaScript hook
- [ ] Theme state properly updates across all LiveView processes

### Technical Requirements
- **Technologies**: Phoenix LiveView, JavaScript hooks
- **Interfaces**: Client-side media query detection
- **Performance**: Theme changes should be instantaneous (<100ms)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Tasks**: None (foundation task)
- **External Dependencies**: Existing Phoenix LiveView application

## Task 1.2: Theme Toggle Component
**ID**: 1.2  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Type**: Development  

### Description
Create an accessible theme toggle component that allows users to switch between light, dark, and auto modes. The component should be keyboard navigable and provide clear visual feedback.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Toggle component with three states: Light, Dark, Auto
- [ ] Accessible keyboard navigation (Tab, Space, Enter)
- [ ] Clear visual indication of current theme
- [ ] ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Smooth transition animations between states

### Technical Requirements
- **Technologies**: Phoenix LiveView, Tailwind CSS, ARIA standards
- **Interfaces**: LiveView event system
- **Performance**: Component render time <50ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Tasks**: Task 1.1 (Theme State Management)
- **External Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS classes

## Task 1.3: Local Storage Integration
**ID**: 1.3  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Type**: Development  

### Description
Implement client-side theme persistence using JavaScript hooks and localStorage. Theme preferences should be saved locally and restored on page load.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Theme preference saved to localStorage on change
- [ ] Theme preference restored from localStorage on page load
- [ ] Fallback to system preference when no saved preference exists
- [ ] Hook properly integrated with Phoenix LiveView lifecycle
- [ ] Handle localStorage unavailability gracefully

### Technical Requirements
- **Technologies**: JavaScript, localStorage API, Phoenix LiveView hooks
- **Interfaces**: Browser storage API
- **Performance**: Storage operations <10ms
- **Security**: No sensitive data stored in localStorage

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisite Tasks**: Can run in parallel with Task 1.2
- **External Dependencies**: Browser localStorage support

## Phase Coordination
All tasks in this phase work together to establish the foundation theme system:
- Task 1.1 provides the server-side state management
- Task 1.2 provides the user interface for theme control  
- Task 1.3 provides persistence across browser sessions

The successful completion of this phase enables Phase 2 to focus on applying theme styling to UI components.
