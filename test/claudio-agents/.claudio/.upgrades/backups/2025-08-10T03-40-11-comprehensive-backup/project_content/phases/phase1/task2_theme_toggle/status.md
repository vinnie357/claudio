# Task 1.2: Theme Toggle Component Status

## Overview
- **Task**: 1.2 - Theme Toggle Component  
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Start Date**: TBD
- **Target Completion**: TBD  
- **Actual Completion**: TBD
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%

## Implementation Checklist
### Not Started ‚è∏
- [ ] Design component HTML structure and layout
- [ ] Add menu visibility state to socket assigns
- [ ] Implement theme menu toggle event handler
- [ ] Create accessible component template with ARIA labels
- [ ] Style component with Tailwind CSS classes
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Implement focus management and indicators
- [ ] Write component functionality tests
- [ ] Perform manual accessibility testing

## Technical Details
### Files to Modify
- `lib/task_app_web/live/task_live/index.ex` - Add component logic and events
- Template section in render/1 function - Add theme toggle component
- `test/task_app_web/live/task_live/theme_toggle_test.exs` - Component tests (to create)

### Component Specifications
- **States**: Light, Dark, Auto modes
- **Interaction**: Dropdown or button group interface
- **Position**: Application header area
- **Icons**: Sun (light), moon (dark), auto symbol
- **Keyboard Support**: Tab, Space, Enter, Escape keys

## Dependencies
### Prerequisites  
- [ ] Task 1.1 (Theme State Management) must be completed
- [ ] Theme state available in socket assigns as `:theme`
- [ ] Theme change event handlers implemented

### Blocking Issues
- Task 1.1 completion required before starting this task

## Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
- [ ] Focus indicators clearly visible

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Accessibility standards compliance
- [ ] Component tests passing
- [ ] Visual design review completed  
- [ ] Integration with theme state verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tested

## Design Decisions
- Using dropdown menu approach for three theme options
- Positioning toggle in application header for easy access
- Following existing application visual design patterns
- Implementing smooth transitions for better user experience

## Integration Notes
- Component must integrate with theme state from Task 1.1
- Menu state (`:show_theme_menu`) will be added to socket assigns
- Theme selection will trigger existing theme change events

## Next Actions  
1. Wait for Task 1.1 completion
2. Review theme state implementation from Task 1.1
3. Design component mockup and review with team
4. Begin HTML structure implementation

## Coordination Notes
- Can proceed in parallel with Task 1.3 once this task is complete
- Component will be used in Phase 2 for testing theme application across UI elements
