# Task Collaboration Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Transform the Simple Task Manager from an individual productivity tool into a collaborative team workspace that enables seamless task sharing, assignment, and team coordination while maintaining the simplicity that makes the application approachable.

### Key Objectives
- **Primary**: Enable multi-user task collaboration and assignment capabilities
- **Secondary**: Establish foundation for team workspace features
- **Tertiary**: Improve user engagement through social productivity features

### Success Definition
Success will be measured by increased user engagement, task completion rates in team contexts, and user retention through collaborative features that differentiate the application from basic to-do tools.

### Timeline Overview
- **Phase 1 (4 weeks)**: Core collaboration infrastructure and basic sharing
- **Phase 2 (6 weeks)**: Advanced assignment and notification systems
- **Phase 3 (4 weeks)**: Team management and permission controls

## Project Context

### Current State
The Simple Task Manager currently operates as a single-user productivity application with:
- Individual task management (create, edit, update status)
- Basic user authentication via JWT
- Simple React/TypeScript frontend with Express.js backend
- SQLite development and PostgreSQL production databases

### Problem Statement
Users cannot collaborate on tasks, share workloads, or coordinate team efforts within the application. This limitation prevents the application from addressing team productivity needs and limits growth potential in the collaborative workspace market.

### Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive task collaboration system that allows users to share tasks, assign responsibilities, track team progress, and coordinate through integrated notification and communication features.

### Business Impact
- **User Retention**: Collaborative features typically increase user engagement by 40-60%
- **Market Expansion**: Access to team and organizational customer segments
