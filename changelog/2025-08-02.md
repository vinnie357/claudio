# Changelog - August 2, 2025

## Overview
Major enhancement to the Claudio system introducing orchestrator-based architecture for efficient parallel workflow execution. This update restructures the Claudio coordination system with specialized orchestrator agents that manage complex project analysis workflows through parallel sub-agent execution.

## Agent Architecture Enhancement

### New Orchestrator Agent System
- **claudio-coordinator**: Master orchestration agent for complete Claudio workflow management
- **claudio-discovery-orchestrator**: Specialized project discovery and technology analysis
- **claudio-prd-orchestrator**: Product Requirements Document creation from discovery findings
- **claudio-plan-orchestrator**: Implementation planning with phases and timeline estimation
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration between orchestrator agents with proper dependency management

### Parallel Execution Framework
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Properly ordered workflow phases (discovery → PRD → plan → task → structure)
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Parallel sub-agent execution where possible to reduce workflow time
- **Error Isolation**: Independent phase execution prevents cascading failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time workflow progress reporting across all orchestrator phases

### Context Management Improvements
- **Dynamic Context Reference**: Agents check local installation first, then fallback to global prompts
- **Extended Context Integration**: Proper referencing of prompt contexts for specialized guidance
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains existing project status across workflow updates
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient context usage through specialized agent focus
