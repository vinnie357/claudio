# Microservices Orchestration Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Service Discovery Failures in Kubernetes
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Services unable to resolve DNS names (nslookup failures)
  - Intermittent connection timeouts between services
  - LoadBalancer services not receiving traffic
  - "connection refused" errors despite service being ready
- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Check DNS resolution: `kubectl exec -it pod-name -- nslookup service-name`
  - Verify service endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints service-name`
  - Examine CoreDNS logs: `kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/coredns`
  - Test network connectivity: `kubectl exec -it source-pod -- telnet target-service port`
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify service selector matches pod labels exactly
  2. Ensure pods are in Running state and passing readiness probes
  3. Check network policies aren't blocking inter-service communication
  4. Restart CoreDNS if DNS resolution is consistently failing
  5. Validate service account permissions for cross-namespace communication
- **Prevention**: 
  - Implement comprehensive health checks and readiness probes
  - Use service mesh for advanced traffic management and observability
  - Monitor DNS query patterns and CoreDNS performance metrics
  - Establish naming conventions and namespace organization policies

### Issue 2: Service Mesh Certificate Management Failures
- **Symptoms**:

  - Test mTLS configuration: `istioctl authn tls-check service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify cert-manager is properly configured and operational
  2. Check ClusterIssuer and Certificate resources for errors
  3. Manually rotate certificates if automatic rotation fails
  4. Ensure proper RBAC permissions for certificate management
  5. Validate time synchronization across cluster nodes (NTP configuration)
- **Prevention**:
