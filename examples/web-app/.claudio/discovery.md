## Recommended MCPs

Based on comprehensive project analysis and latest Claudio capabilities:

### Essential MCPs for Development
1. **filesystem**: Critical for JSON-based task storage and static file serving
   - Use case: Managing persistent task data and serving SPA assets
   - Priority: High - Core functionality depends on file operations

2. **sqlite**: For database upgrade path and advanced querying
   - Use case: Scaling from JSON to structured database storage
   - Priority: Medium - Future enhancement for performance

### Development Workflow MCPs
3. **github**: For repository management and CI/CD integration
   - Use case: Version control, issue tracking, automated deployment
   - Priority: Medium - Team collaboration and automation

4. **docker**: For containerized development and deployment
   - Use case: Consistent development environment and production deployment
   - Priority: Low - Deployment optimization

### Enhanced Development MCPs
5. **memory**: For session management and application caching
   - Use case: User session persistence and performance optimization

- **Low Risk**: JSON storage limitations → Mitigation: Clear SQLite migration path
- **High Risk**: Performance requirements → Mitigation: Performance budget and monitoring

### Development Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Team learning curve → Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Low Risk**: Deployment complexity → Mitigation: Containerized deployment strategy
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-browser compatibility → Mitigation: Progressive enhancement approach

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions
1. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
2. Set up basic Deno server with static file serving
3. Create foundational directory structure
4. Implement core API endpoints for task operations
5. Build basic HTML template with responsive CSS framework

### Integration Opportunities
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI for performance tracking
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting in pre-commit hooks
- **Documentation**: Automated API documentation generation

This discovery provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing the Task Manager SPA with modern development practices and a clear path to production deployment.
