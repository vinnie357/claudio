# React Hooks Patterns for State Management Research Overview

## Complexity Assessment
- Topic Complexity: 7/10 (Think Mode)
- Key Complexity Factors: Multiple interrelated hooks, performance optimization considerations, various implementation patterns, integration with different state management approaches

## Executive Summary

React hooks have matured significantly by 2024, offering developers sophisticated patterns for state management that can replace or complement traditional state management libraries like Redux. The core hooks - useState, useReducer, useContext, useMemo, and useCallback - when combined strategically, provide powerful solutions for both local and global state management. Modern React development emphasizes a profile-first approach to performance optimization, using hooks judiciously to solve real performance bottlenecks rather than premature optimization.

The landscape shows a clear preference hierarchy: useState for simple component state, useContext + useReducer for shared module-level state, and Redux or similar libraries for complex global state in large applications. However, many developers can effectively handle their state management needs with hooks alone, avoiding the complexity of third-party libraries.

Performance optimization through useMemo and useCallback requires careful consideration - these hooks provide genuine benefits when used correctly but can introduce overhead and complexity when overused. The key is understanding when expensive calculations or frequent re-renders actually impact user experience and applying memoization strategically.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Basic State Management Hooks

**useState**
- Primary hook for simple component-level state
- Best for primitive values, simple objects, and straightforward state transitions
- Triggers re-renders when state changes
- Ideal for form inputs, toggles, and basic UI state

**useReducer**
- Advanced alternative to useState for complex state logic
- Centralizes state update logic through a reducer function
- Best when state has multiple sub-values or interdependent properties
- Provides more predictable state transitions through action dispatching
- Improves performance for components with deep update patterns

### 2. Global State Management Patterns

**useContext + useState Pattern**
- Combines Context API with useState for shared state
- Eliminates prop drilling for simple global state
- Suitable for small to medium applications
- Easy to implement and understand

**useContext + useReducer Pattern**
- Most powerful combination for complex global state
- Centralizes both state storage and update logic
- Scales well for larger applications
- Provides Redux-like benefits with built-in React features

### 3. Performance Optimization Hooks

**useMemo**
- Memoizes expensive calculations
- Prevents unnecessary recalculations on re-renders
- Most effective with complex computations, data transformations, or large datasets
- Use when profiling reveals actual performance bottlenecks

**useCallback**
- Memoizes function references
- Prevents child component re-renders when passing callbacks
- Critical for optimized components that depend on referential equality
- Essential when creating custom hooks that return functions

## Best Practices

### State Management Selection Criteria

1. **Component-Level State**: Use useState for local component state that doesn't need sharing
2. **Module-Level State**: Use useContext + useState/useReducer for state shared within feature modules
3. **Application-Level State**: Consider useContext + useReducer for lighter applications, Redux for complex global state
4. **Performance-Critical State**: Profile first, then apply useMemo/useCallback for genuine bottlenecks

### Reducer Pattern Guidelines

- Keep reducer functions pure (no side effects)
- Use immutable state updates
- Implement descriptive action types following consistent naming conventions
- Break complex reducers into smaller, composable functions
- Use action creators for consistent dispatching patterns

### Context Implementation Best Practices

- Split contexts by feature/domain to minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Provide contexts at the appropriate level in component tree
- Use multiple contexts rather than one large context for better performance
- Consider context value memoization for complex objects

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

- Profile before optimizing - measure actual performance impact
- Avoid premature optimization with useMemo/useCallback
- Include all dependencies in dependency arrays to prevent stale closures
- Use React Developer Tools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
- Consider React.memo for component-level optimization

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Simple Global State with Context

```javascript
// Create context
const AppContext = createContext();

// Provider component
const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

// Consumer hook
const useAppState = () => {
  const context = useContext(AppContext);
  if (\!context) {
    throw new Error('useAppState must be used within AppProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

### 2. Complex State with useReducer

```javascript
// Define actions
const ACTIONS = {
  ADD_ITEM: 'ADD_ITEM',
  REMOVE_ITEM: 'REMOVE_ITEM',
  UPDATE_ITEM: 'UPDATE_ITEM',
  SET_LOADING: 'SET_LOADING'
};

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ACTIONS.ADD_ITEM:
      return {
        ...state,
        items: [...state.items, action.payload]
      };
    case ACTIONS.REMOVE_ITEM:
      return {
        ...state,
        items: state.items.filter(item => item.id \!== action.payload.id)
      };
    case ACTIONS.SET_LOADING:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: action.payload
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Context provider
const StateProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  
  return (
    <StateContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </StateContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### 3. Performance-Optimized Custom Hook

```javascript
const useOptimizedData = (data, filters) => {
  // Memoize expensive filtering operation
  const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.filter(item => 
      filters.every(filter => filter.test(item))
    );
  }, [data, filters]);
  
  // Memoize callback to prevent child re-renders
  const handleItemSelect = useCallback((item) => {
    // Handle selection logic
  }, [/* dependencies */]);
  
  return {
    filteredData,
    handleItemSelect
  };
};
```

### 4. Async State Management Pattern

```javascript
const useAsyncState = (asyncFunction, dependencies) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(asyncReducer, {
    loading: false,
    data: null,
    error: null
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;
    
    const executeAsync = async () => {
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });
      
      try {
        const result = await asyncFunction();
        if (\!cancelled) {
          dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: result });
        }
      } catch (error) {
        if (\!cancelled) {
          dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', payload: error });
        }
      }
    };
    
    executeAsync();
    
    return () => {
      cancelled = true;
    };
  }, dependencies);
  
  return state;
};
```
