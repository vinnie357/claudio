# Task 1.4 Status: Session Management

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 1.4
- **Task Name**: Session Management
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Authentication Foundation
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 day
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Started**: [Waiting for prerequisite tasks]
- **Last Updated**: [Initial status]
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Task 1 (User Schema) - completed
- **Required**: Task 2 (Auth Context) - needed for authentication functions
- **Required**: Task 3 (Auth UI) - needed for login/logout flows
- **Status**: Waiting for Tasks 2 and 3 completion

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] Authentication plugs for route protection
- [ ] Session persistence across requests
- [ ] Secure logout functionality with cleanup
- [ ] Session security configuration
- [ ] Current user helpers and access functions
- [ ] Authentication state management in LiveView
- [ ] Session token management and rotation
- [ ] Integration with existing middleware stack

## Implementation Plan
### Phase A: Core Session Infrastructure (0.3 days)
- [ ] Create authentication plug module
- [ ] Configure session security settings
- [ ] Set up basic session helpers

### Phase B: Authentication Integration (0.4 days)
- [ ] Integrate with authentication context
- [ ] Implement route protection plugs
- [ ] Create current user lookup functions
- [ ] Handle session state in LiveView

### Phase C: Security and Testing (0.3 days)
- [ ] Implement secure logout with cleanup
- [ ] Add session token rotation
- [ ] Comprehensive security testing
- [ ] Integration testing with auth UI flows

## Technical Decisions
(To be documented as implementation progresses)

### Session Strategy
- Session storage: TBD (Phoenix default vs. custom)
- Token rotation frequency: TBD
- Session timeout duration: TBD
- Remember-me implementation: TBD (optional feature)

## Security Configuration Planning
- Cookie security flags: httpOnly, secure, sameSite
- Session timeout: Consider user experience vs. security
- CSRF protection: Integrate with existing app protection
- Token management: Secure generation and validation

## Current Work
**Status**: Ready to begin after Tasks 2 and 3 completion
**Preparation**: Can review Phoenix session documentation and security best practices

## Integration Points
- Must work with existing TaskApp routing structure
- Need to coordinate with LiveView components
- Should maintain consistency with app architecture patterns
- Prepare for Phase 2 authorization requirements

## Issues and Blockers
- Waiting for Task 2 (Auth Context) completion for authentication functions
- Waiting for Task 3 (Auth UI) completion for login/logout flow integration
- Need to review existing app middleware configuration

## Next Steps (after prerequisite tasks)
1. Review completed authentication context and UI flows
2. Implement authentication plug infrastructure
3. Configure secure session management
4. Integrate with LiveView authentication patterns
5. Comprehensive testing of session flows

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All authentication flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Security configuration meets best practices
- [ ] Session performance optimized
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] LiveView authentication working correctly

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for authentication plugs
- Integration tests for session flows
- Security testing for session management
- Performance testing for user lookup operations
- End-to-end testing with complete auth flows

## Security Considerations
- Session fixation prevention
- Proper logout and session cleanup
- Token security and rotation
- CSRF protection integration
- Attack surface minimization

## Performance Requirements
- Efficient current user lookup
- Minimal database queries for session operations
- Optimized session storage and retrieval
- Fast authentication state checking

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria met and:
- Complete authentication flow working (register → login → access → logout)
- Security review passed
- Integration testing successful
- Performance requirements validated

## Phase 1 Completion Impact
Upon completion of this task, Phase 1 will be complete with:
- Users can register and authenticate
- Sessions persist securely across requests
- Complete authentication foundation ready for Phase 2 authorization work
