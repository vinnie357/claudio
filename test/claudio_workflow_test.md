# Claudio Complete Workflow Test

This file contains validation prompts to test the `/claudio:claudio` command complete workflow orchestration in a new Claude Code session.

## Purpose

Validate that:
1. **Claudio Coordinator Orchestration**: The claudio-coordinator-agent properly manages the complete workflow from discovery through task creation
2. **Sequential and Parallel Execution**: Proper coordination of discovery → workflow generation → structure finalization → validation
3. **Complete Workflow Generation**: Discovery, PRD, implementation plan, and task breakdown all generated successfully
4. **Quality Validation**: Workflow-validator ensures all documents meet quality standards
5. **Structure Creation**: Complete .claudio/ directory with organized documentation and task breakdown
6. **Integration Validation**: All workflow components work together as integrated system

## Sample Application

The validation tests use the DataFlow analytics platform located in `test/workflow/`. This application provides:

- **Technology Stack**: Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Apache Kafka, React, Docker
- **Architecture**: Event-driven microservices with real-time data processing and analytics dashboards
- **Features**: DataFlow analytics platform with real-time data ingestion, processing, and visualization
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-native deployment with streaming data pipelines and machine learning integration
- **Development Priorities**: Performance optimization, scalability enhancements, and ML/AI integration
- **Complexity**: High-complexity data platform requiring comprehensive analysis and structured planning

This realistic analytics platform allows thorough testing of Claudio's complete workflow generation capabilities across data engineering, backend architecture, frontend development, and cloud infrastructure.

## Validation Prompt

```
Please test the Claudio complete workflow by performing the following validation:

### 1. Workflow Command Execution Test
Test the complete `/claudio:claudio` command using the system testing agent:

**Agent Invocation**: "Use the claudio:claudio-test-suite subagent to execute and validate the complete /claudio:claudio test/workflow workflow, including claudio-coordinator-agent orchestration, sequential and parallel execution patterns, and comprehensive workflow validation"

**Expected Behavior**:
a) **Command Execution**: Execute `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "/claudio:claudio test/workflow"` successfully (complete workflow generation)
b) **Coordinator Orchestration**: Claudio-coordinator-agent should orchestrate complete workflow through all phases
c) **Discovery Analysis**: Should run comprehensive project discovery analysis on DataFlow analytics platform
d) **Requirements Creation**: Should generate comprehensive PRD based on DataFlow analysis
e) **Implementation Planning**: Should create detailed implementation plan with phases and time estimates
f) **Task Breakdown**: Should break down plan into executable tasks with specialized contexts
g) **Structure Finalization**: Should organize all outputs into proper .claudio/ directory structure
h) **Quality Validation**: Should validate all documents meet workflow quality standards

### 2. Claudio Coordinator Agent Orchestration Test
Verify the claudio-coordinator-agent manages the complete workflow:

The claudio-coordinator-agent should orchestrate the complete workflow through its internal coordination process. This test validates that the single agent invocation above properly manages:

   - Architecture analysis (event-driven microservices, real-time processing)
   - Development priorities and enhancement opportunities

#### Phase 2: Core Workflow Generation (Parallel Execution)
**CRITICAL: The claudio-coordinator-agent should run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message**
b) **Requirements Generation**: Launch prd-agent to create comprehensive product requirements based on DataFlow analysis

c) **Implementation Planning**: Launch plan-agent to create detailed implementation plan with phases, time estimates, and resource allocation

d) **Task Breakdown**: Launch task-agent to break down the plan into executable tasks with specialized contexts and acceptance criteria

#### Phase 3: Structure Finalization (Sequential)
e) **Structure Creation**: Launch claudio-structure-creator-agent to finalize .claudio/ directory structure and create comprehensive summary documentation

#### Phase 4: Quality Validation (Sequential)

- Fix quality validation issues or document generation problems
- Retest specific failing components before complete revalidation

## Notes for Implementation

This validation should be run in a **new Claude Code session** after any changes to the claudio-coordinator-agent or related workflow components, as agents are only loaded at session start.

The test focuses on **complete workflow orchestration with quality validation** rather than individual document functionality, ensuring the entire workflow system works as an integrated, high-quality process that produces actionable development roadmaps.
```

## Validation Execution

Run this validation by copying the validation prompt above into a new Claude Code session and executing the test command. Document results in the accompanying validation results file.
