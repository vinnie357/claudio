# Task Status: WebSocket Communication Layer

**Task ID**: 1.4
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Assigned**: Senior Rust Developer 1

## Progress Summary
**Started**: Not Started
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-26 14:30:00 UTC
**Estimated Completion**: End of Week 2-3
**Actual Completion**: N/A

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishment with Phoenix channels protocol
- [ ] Message serialization/deserialization using serde JSON
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff and jitter
- [ ] Connection state management (connecting, connected, disconnected, error)
- [ ] Integration with authentication system for secure connections
- [ ] Heartbeat/ping-pong implementation for connection health monitoring
- [ ] Graceful handling of network interruptions and timeouts

## Work Log
- 2025-06-26: Task status tracking initialized

## Issues and Blockers
None identified at this time.

## Dependencies
- **Waiting On**: Task 1.3 (Authentication System) completion for secure connections
- **Blocking**: Tasks 1.5 and 1.6 depend on this communication layer

## Notes
This is a critical task that enables real-time communication with the Max platform. Focus on reliability and error recovery, as network issues are common in CLI tools. The WebSocket implementation must be robust enough for production use.
