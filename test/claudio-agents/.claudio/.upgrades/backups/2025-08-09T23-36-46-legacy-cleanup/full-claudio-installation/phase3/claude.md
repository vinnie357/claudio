# Phase 3: Testing and Security Agent

You are a specialized agent for Phase 3 of the Phoenix Task App User Authentication project. Your role is to coordinate and execute tasks within this phase while maintaining alignment with overall project objectives.

## Phase Overview
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Objectives**: Comprehensive testing and security hardening of the complete authentication system
- **Dependencies**: Completed Phase 2 (Authorization Integration)
- **Deliverables**: Authentication test suite, security audit, integration tests, performance validation

## Phase Tasks
### Task 1: Authentication Test Suite (Priority: High)
- **Directory**: `task1_auth_test_suite/`
- **Duration**: 0.5 days
- **Assignee**: QA Engineer / Backend Developer
- **Focus**: Comprehensive testing of all authentication functionality

### Task 2: Security Audit (Priority: High)
- **Directory**: `task2_security_audit/`
- **Duration**: 0.5 days
- **Assignee**: Security Engineer / Senior Developer
- **Focus**: Security review and vulnerability assessment

### Task 3: Integration Testing (Priority: High)
- **Directory**: `task3_integration_testing/`
- **Duration**: 0.5 days
- **Assignee**: QA Engineer / Full-stack Developer
- **Focus**: End-to-end testing of complete authentication workflows

### Task 4: Performance Validation (Priority: High)
- **Directory**: `task4_performance_validation/`
- **Duration**: 0.5 days
- **Assignee**: Performance Engineer / Backend Developer
- **Focus**: Performance benchmarking and optimization validation

## Context Management
- **Individual Task Contexts**: Each task has specific context in its respective directory
- **Previous Phases**: Builds on complete authentication and authorization system from Phases 1 and 2
- **Next Phase Preparation**: This is the final phase - prepare for production deployment

## Success Criteria
- Complete authentication test coverage (>95%)
- Security vulnerabilities identified and mitigated
- All integration workflows tested and functional
- Performance requirements met or exceeded
- System ready for production deployment
- Documentation complete for maintenance and troubleshooting

## Communication Protocols
This phase validates the entire authentication system built in Phases 1 and 2. Each task should thoroughly validate the system from different perspectives while coordinating to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Quality Assurance Standards
- Comprehensive test coverage for all authentication scenarios
- Security best practices implementation validated
- Performance benchmarks documented and met
- Integration workflows tested under realistic conditions
- Error handling and edge cases thoroughly validated

## Testing Strategy
### Multi-Layer Validation
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component functionality
2. **Integration Testing**: Complete workflow validation
3. **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and optimization validation
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Real-world usage scenario validation

## Security Focus Areas
- Authentication security (password handling, session management)
- Authorization security (access control, data isolation)
- Session security (fixation, hijacking, timeout)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling that doesn't leak information
- CSRF and other web security vulnerabilities

## Performance Requirements
- Authentication operations within acceptable response times
- User-scoped queries optimized for production load
- Session management efficient under concurrent users
- Database performance maintained with authentication overhead
- Memory and CPU usage within acceptable limits

## Integration Validation
- Complete user registration → login → task management → logout flow
- Authentication state consistency across LiveView and traditional requests
- Error handling and recovery in all scenarios
- Cross-browser and device compatibility
- Accessibility compliance throughout authentication flows
