## Security Vulnerability Assessment

### Critical Vulnerabilities
```markdown
# Critical security issues requiring immediate attention
- **Remote Code Execution**: Code injection vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Database query injection vulnerabilities
- **Authentication Bypass**: Authentication mechanism circumvention
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access level increases
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Unencrypted sensitive information disclosure
```

### High-Risk Vulnerabilities
```markdown
# High-risk security issues requiring prompt remediation
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Template and input validation issues
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: CSRF token implementation issues
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Unauthorized resource access
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Phoenix configuration security issues
- **Broken Session Management**: Session handling security vulnerabilities
```

### Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities
```markdown
# Medium-risk security issues for planned remediation
- **Insufficient Logging**: Security event logging gaps
- **Weak Encryption**: Inadequate cryptographic implementation
- **Information Disclosure**: Verbose error messages and debug information
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
- **Weak Input Validation**: Input sanitization improvements needed
```

## Task Tool Integration

When additional security research is needed:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "research-specialist" to research Phoenix security best practices and OWASP guidelines for Elixir applications
```

When code quality analysis supports security findings:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "code-quality-analyzer" to analyze code quality aspects that impact security posture
```

## Security Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Automated Security Analysis
```elixir
# Automated vulnerability scanning and analysis
automated_analysis = [
  dependency_scanning: "Scan mix.exs dependencies for known vulnerabilities",
  static_analysis: "Perform static code analysis for security issues",
  configuration_review: "Analyze Phoenix configuration security settings",
  code_pattern_analysis: "Review code patterns for security anti-patterns"
]
```

### Phase 2: Manual Security Review
```elixir
# Manual security assessment and penetration testing
manual_review = [
  authentication_testing: "Manual testing of authentication mechanisms",
  authorization_testing: "Manual verification of authorization controls",
  input_validation_testing: "Manual input validation and sanitization testing",
  session_management_testing: "Manual session security testing"
]
```

### Phase 3: Compliance Assessment
```elixir
# Security compliance and standards assessment
compliance_assessment = [
  owasp_compliance: "OWASP Top 10 compliance verification",
  privacy_compliance: "GDPR and privacy regulation compliance",
  industry_standards: "Industry-specific security standard compliance",
  internal_policies: "Internal security policy compliance verification"
]
```
