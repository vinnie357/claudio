   - Generates topic-specific expert prompts with examples and troubleshooting
   - Creates specialized agent contexts for any research topic
   - Supports categorized organization of research content

2. **Discovery Agent** (`prompts/discovery/claude.md`)
   - Analyzes project structure, technology stack, and dependencies
   - Identifies development tools and workflows
   - Recommends relevant MCPs for enhanced development
   - Provides comprehensive project capability assessment

3. **Documentation Agent** (`prompts/documentation/claude.md`)
   - Creates clear, comprehensive documentation for software projects
   - Supports multiple documentation types (README, API, user guides, developer docs)
   - Focuses on user-friendly content with practical examples
   - Maintains consistent documentation standards

4. **PRD Agent** (`prompts/prd/claude.md`)
   - Generates Product Requirements Documents with clear requirements and success criteria
   - Transforms business needs into actionable technical specifications
   - Includes functional/non-functional requirements and measurable outcomes
   - Integrates with documentation standards when needed

5. **Plan Agent** (`prompts/plan/claude.md`)

6. **Task Agent** (`prompts/task/claude.md`)
   - Creates detailed task lists and specialized agent contexts for phases
   - Generates phase-specific and task-specific agent contexts
   - Handles context creation strategy based on complexity
   - Establishes proper context referencing and dependencies

7. **Claudio Master Agent** (`prompts/claudio/claude.md`)
   - Orchestrates the complete project lifecycle from discovery through task implementation
   - Coordinates all specialized agents to create complete implementation roadmaps
   - Manages comprehensive project structure with progress tracking
   - Integrates all agent contexts into cohesive workflow

### Commands (`.claude/commands/`)
Created executable commands that leverage the agent prompts:

1. **Research Command** (`/research`)
   - Usage: `/research <category> <topic>`
   - Generates specialized research with examples and troubleshooting
   - Output: `research/<category>/<topic>.md` (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/research/<category>/<topic>.md` (within Claudio)

2. **Discovery Command** (`/discovery`)
   - Usage: `/discovery [directory_path]`
   - Analyzes project structure and suggests MCPs
   - Output: `discovery/reports/<project>_discovery.md` (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/discovery.md` (within Claudio)

3. **Documentation Command** (`/documentation`)
   - Usage: `/documentation <doc_type> [project_path]`
   - Types: readme, api, user, developer, full
   - Output: `docs/` (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/docs/` (within Claudio)

4. **PRD Command** (`/prd`)
   - Usage: `/prd <prd_type> <project_name> [additional_context]`
   - Types: feature, enhancement, integration, migration, full
   - Output: `prd/documents/<project>_prd.md` (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/prd.md` (within Claudio)

5. **Plan Command** (`/plan`)
   - Usage: `/plan <plan_type> <project_name> [duration_constraint]`
   - Types: feature, project, migration, refactor, integration

6. **Task Command** (`/task`)
   - Usage: `/task <plan_file_path> [project_name]`
   - Creates phase and task contexts based on complexity
   - Output: Directory structure (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/phases/` (within Claudio)

7. **Claudio Master Command** (`/claudio`)
   - Usage: `/claudio <target_project_path>`
   - Executes complete workflow: discovery → PRD → plan → tasks
   - Creates comprehensive `.claudio/` folder in target project

## Key Features Implemented

### Dual Output Strategy
- **Direct Commands**: Save to project-specific directories when run standalone
- **Claudio Workflow**: All outputs organized in target project's `.claudio/` folder
- **Context Integration**: Agents reference each other's contexts when needed

### Context Management
- **Simple Phases (≤2 tasks)**: Single phase context file
- **Complex Phases (>2 tasks)**: Phase context + individual task contexts
- **Shared Resources**: Common utilities and standards contexts
- **Cross-References**: Proper linking between related contexts

### Project Structure
Created organized folder structure:
```
claudio/
├── prompts/              # Agent prompt contexts
├── .claude/commands/     # Executable commands
├── examples/            # Sample projects
├── changelog/           # This changelog
├── README.md           # User guide
└── CLAUDE.md           # System documentation
```

## Example Projects Created

- Provides realistic project for testing Claudio analysis

### Rust Game Example (`examples/rust-game/`)
- Chess game implementation using Rust and Bevy engine
- Detailed project description with 3D graphics and multiplayer features
