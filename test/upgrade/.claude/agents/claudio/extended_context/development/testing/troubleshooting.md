# Testing Troubleshooting for TaskFlow

## Common Issues

### React Native Test Environment Setup
**Problem**: Jest tests fail with React Native-specific modules and components
**Solution**: Configure Jest with React Native preset, mock platform-specific modules, use testing-library/react-native for component testing

### Cross-Platform Testing Inconsistencies  
**Problem**: Tests pass on one platform but fail on iOS or Android
**Solution**: Use platform-specific test configurations, mock platform differences, run tests on both simulator environments

### Microservices Integration Testing
**Problem**: Service integration tests fail due to database or network dependencies
**Solution**: Use test containers for database isolation, implement proper test setup/teardown, mock external service dependencies

### AI/ML Service Testing Challenges
**Problem**: Python TensorFlow services difficult to test with model dependencies
**Solution**: Mock ML models for unit tests, use test data sets for integration tests, separate model accuracy testing from service logic testing

### WebSocket Testing Complexity
**Problem**: Real-time synchronization features difficult to test reliably
**Solution**: Use WebSocket testing libraries, implement proper connection mocking, test message ordering and delivery

## Debug Strategies
- Use Jest debugging tools with React Native debugger integration
- Implement proper test isolation with database cleanup between tests
- Use supertest for API endpoint testing with proper request/response validation
- Mock external dependencies consistently across test suites
- Implement test data factories for consistent TaskFlow test scenarios
