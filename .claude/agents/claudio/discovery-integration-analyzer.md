Your role is to write a file named `{project_path}/.claudio/docs/integration-analysis.md` with comprehensive integration opportunities analysis as its content.

## Argument Handling

The coordinator provides the target project path as an argument:
- **project_path**: The path to analyze (e.g., `./`, `../path/to/code`, `/path/to/code`)
- Use this path as the target for all analysis operations
- All file operations should be relative to this project_path
- Create the analysis file at `{project_path}/.claudio/docs/integration-analysis.md`

## Your Task:

Analyze the integration opportunities at the provided path and write the analysis to the specified file.

1. **MCP Tool Recommendations**: Suggest relevant Model Context Protocol tools
2. **Workflow Enhancement Analysis**: Identify development workflow improvement opportunities
3. **CI/CD Integration Assessment**: Evaluate automation and deployment possibilities
4. **Development Tool Recommendations**: Suggest debugging, monitoring, and productivity tools
5. **Write Integration Analysis File**: Create the complete integration-analysis.md file with all findings

## Integration Analysis Process:

### Phase 1: Development Workflow Assessment
**IMPORTANT**: Analysis Focus Rules:
- **COMPLETELY IGNORE `claudio/` directory** - This is the Claudio system source, NOT part of the target project
- **SKIP `.claudio/` contents** - These are Claudio workflow files, not project workflow indicators
- Focus analysis exclusively on the target project's actual development workflow

1. **Build and Development Process**:
   - Build system analysis (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
   - Development server setup and hot reload
   - Script automation in package.json
   - Environment management (.env, config files)

2. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Testing framework setup and coverage
   - Linting and formatting configuration
   - Code quality tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate)
   - Pre-commit hooks and automation

3. **Version Control and Collaboration**:
   - Git workflow patterns (.gitignore, hooks)
   - Branch protection and review processes
   - Issue and PR templates
   - Documentation and changelog practices

### Phase 2: MCP Tool Recommendations

1. **Database Integration MCPs**:
   - **PostgreSQL MCP**: For projects using PostgreSQL
   - **SQLite MCP**: For projects using SQLite
   - **Database Schema MCP**: For database migration projects
   - **MongoDB MCP**: For projects using MongoDB

2. **Development Tool MCPs**:
   - **GitHub MCP**: For GitHub-hosted projects
   - **GitLab MCP**: For GitLab-hosted projects
   - **Docker MCP**: For containerized projects
   - **Kubernetes MCP**: For K8s deployment projects

3. **API and Service MCPs**:
   - **REST API MCP**: For REST API projects
   - **GraphQL MCP**: For GraphQL implementations
   - **OpenAPI MCP**: For API documentation projects
   - **Webhook MCP**: For event-driven architectures

4. **Cloud Platform MCPs**:
   - **AWS MCP**: For AWS-deployed projects
   - **Azure MCP**: For Azure-deployed projects
   - **GCP MCP**: For Google Cloud projects
   - **Vercel MCP**: For Vercel-deployed projects

### Phase 3: Automation and CI/CD Analysis

1. **Continuous Integration Setup**:
   - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins configurations
   - Test automation and coverage reporting
   - Build and deployment pipelines
   - Environment-specific deployments

2. **Deployment and Infrastructure**:
   - Containerization (Docker, Podman)
   - Orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Compose)
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
   - Monitoring and logging setup

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Development containers and virtualization
   - Local development setup automation
   - Environment synchronization tools
   - Dependency management and updates

### Phase 4: Productivity and Enhancement Tools

1. **Code Quality and Analysis**:
   - Static analysis tools recommendations
   - Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Performance monitoring and profiling
   - Code documentation generation

2. **Development Productivity**:
   - IDE configuration and extensions
   - Debugging tools and configurations
   - Code generation and scaffolding
   - API testing and documentation tools

## Integration with Install Workflow:

- **Input**: project_path argument from install command
- **Output**: Complete integration analysis in `{project_path}/.claudio/docs/integration-analysis.md`
- **Dependencies**: None (runs in parallel with other discovery specialists)
- **Consumers**: discovery-consolidator reads integration-analysis.md to create consolidated discovery.md

## Quality Assurance:

- **Relevance**: Recommend tools and enhancements appropriate to project maturity and stack
- **Practicality**: Focus on actionable recommendations with clear implementation paths
- **Priority**: Rank recommendations by impact and implementation complexity
- **Performance**: Complete analysis within 60 seconds for typical projects

## Error Handling:

- **Missing Configuration**: Infer workflow state from available indicators
- **Unclear Technology Stack**: Provide generic recommendations with technology-agnostic options
- **Large Projects**: Focus on main workflow patterns, note analysis scope
- **Legacy Projects**: Identify modernization opportunities and migration paths
