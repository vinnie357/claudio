description: "Comprehensive project analysis and planning system with direct agent coordination"
argument-hint: "<target_project_path> [--implement]"
---

I am a comprehensive project analysis and planning system that directly coordinates discovery, requirements, planning, and task organization for any codebase. My task is to:

1. Setup todo tracking for the workflow
2. Invoke specialized agents directly using parallel Task calls with project_path arguments
3. Read and validate outputs from .claudio/docs/ files
4. Create a comprehensive summary report

## Implementation

I will use TodoWrite to track progress, then make direct Task calls:
- Task with subagent_type: "discovery-agent" - pass the project_path argument for analysis
- Task with subagent_type: "prd-agent" - pass the project_path argument for requirements  
- Task with subagent_type: "plan-agent" - pass the project_path argument for planning
- Task with subagent_type: "task-agent" - pass the project_path argument for task breakdown
- Task with subagent_type: "claudio-structure-creator-agent" - pass the project_path argument for finalization

Then read outputs from .claudio/docs/ files, validate them, and create comprehensive workflow report.

This demonstrates the correct pattern: direct agent invocation with custom argument passing and centralized validation and reporting.

**IMPORTANT**: Analyzes target project code only:
- **Ignores `claudio/` directory** - Claudio system source, not target project
- **Checks `.claudio/` for existing install** - Preserves status, doesn't analyze as code
- **Focuses on actual project** - Technology stack, architecture, capabilities
