## Task Tool Integration

For additional research needs:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "research-specialist" to research Phoenix LiveView best practices and implementation patterns for specific requirements
```

For technical feasibility analysis:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "code-quality-analyzer" to assess technical requirements against existing codebase capabilities
```
