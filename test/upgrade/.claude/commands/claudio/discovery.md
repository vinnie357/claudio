Analyze project structure, technology stack, architecture patterns, and development requirements to create comprehensive discovery documentation. This command provides deep project understanding for development planning and technology decisions, with specialized analysis for TaskFlow Productivity App and cross-platform development.

**CRITICAL**: Use the discovery-agent subagent to perform comprehensive project analysis including technology detection, architecture evaluation, and development workflow recommendations.

**Path Resolution**: Supports multiple ways to specify discovery target:
- **Direct Path**: `/claudio:discovery /path/to/project` (analyzes specified path)
- **Current Directory**: `/claudio:discovery` (analyzes current working directory)

**TaskFlow Specialization**: This command includes enhanced analysis capabilities for:
- **React Native**: Mobile app structure, platform-specific code, native modules
- **Node.js**: Express.js APIs, middleware patterns, database integration
- **Cross-Platform**: Code sharing strategies, synchronized development workflows
- **Productivity Applications**: Task management systems, real-time synchronization
- **Multi-Database**: PostgreSQL and MongoDB integration patterns

This command creates detailed project analysis documentation optimized for TaskFlow's technology stack and cross-platform architecture to inform development decisions and project planning.
