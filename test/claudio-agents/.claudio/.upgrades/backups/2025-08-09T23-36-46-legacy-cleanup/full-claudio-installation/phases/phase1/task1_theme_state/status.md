# Task 1.1: Theme State Management Status

## Overview
- **Task**: 1.1 - Theme State Management
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Start Date**: TBD
- **Target Completion**: TBD
- **Actual Completion**: TBD
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%

## Implementation Checklist
### Not Started ‚è∏
- [ ] Update mount/3 to add theme to socket assigns
- [ ] Implement handle_event/3 for theme change events
- [ ] Create JavaScript hook for system preference detection
- [ ] Add theme resolution helper functions
- [ ] Update LiveView template to include theme hook
- [ ] Write unit tests for theme state management
- [ ] Perform integration testing

## Technical Details
### Files to Modify
- `lib/task_app_web/live/task_live/index.ex` - Main LiveView module
- `assets/js/theme_hook.js` - System preference detection (to create)
- `test/task_app_web/live/task_live/index_test.exs` - Theme tests (to create)

### Key Implementation Points
- Theme state stored as `:theme` in socket assigns
- Default theme value: `"auto"`
- Supported theme values: `"light"`, `"dark"`, `"auto"`
- JavaScript hook name: `ThemeHook`

## Dependencies
### Prerequisites
- [x] Existing Phoenix LiveView application available
- [x] TaskLive.Index module identified for modification

### Blocking Issues
- None currently identified

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Integration testing successful
- [ ] Performance requirements verified (<100ms theme changes)

## Notes and Decisions
- Using socket assigns for theme state provides automatic propagation to child components
- JavaScript hook approach chosen for system preference detection to maintain LiveView patterns
- Theme resolution will be handled server-side for consistency

## Next Actions
1. Begin implementation with mount/3 function update
2. Set up development environment for testing
3. Create JavaScript hook for system preference detection

## Coordination Notes
- Task 1.2 (Theme Toggle) depends on completion of this task
- Task 1.3 (Local Storage) can proceed in parallel once event handling is complete
