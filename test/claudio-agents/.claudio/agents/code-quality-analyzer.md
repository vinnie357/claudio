## Quality Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Credo Analysis
```elixir

credo_config = %{
  checks: [
    # Code readability checks
    {Credo.Check.Readability.AliasOrder, []},
    {Credo.Check.Readability.FunctionNames, []},
    {Credo.Check.Readability.ModuleNames, []},
    
    # Design checks for Phoenix patterns
    {Credo.Check.Design.AliasUsage, [priority: :high]},
    {Credo.Check.Design.DuplicatedCode, [priority: :high]},
    {Credo.Check.Design.TagTODO, [priority: :normal]},
    
    # Refactoring opportunities
    {Credo.Check.Refactor.CyclomaticComplexity, [max_complexity: 12]},
    {Credo.Check.Refactor.FunctionArity, [max_arity: 8]},
    {Credo.Check.Refactor.LongQuoteBlocks, []},
    
    # Warning checks for potential issues
    {Credo.Check.Warning.UnusedFunctionReturnValue, []},
    {Credo.Check.Warning.UnusedKeywordOperation, []},
    {Credo.Check.Warning.UnusedTupleOperation, []},
  ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Dialyxir Static Analysis

    :error_handling,
    :no_opaque,
    :race_conditions,
    :underspecs,
    :unknown,
    :unmatched_returns
  ],
  ignore_warnings: ".dialyzer_ignore.exs"

  event_handling_efficiency: "Analyze LiveView event handling patterns",
  
  # Context analysis
  context_boundary_integrity: "Evaluate Phoenix context boundaries",
  schema_design_quality: "Assess Ecto schema design patterns",
  changeset_validation_completeness: "Evaluate changeset validation patterns"
]
```
