# Manual Install Test Results

## Test Date: August 11, 2024
## Test Command: Full workflow install to test/install

## Pre-Test State
- Target directory: test/install/
- Existing files: README.md, mise.toml, .gitignore, test-file.txt
- No .claude/ or .claudio/ directories present

## Install Full Workflow Agent Test Results

### ‚úÖ Direct Implementation Pattern
- Updated to use install-full-workflow-agent for direct workflow implementation
- No longer requires sub-agent coordination through Task tool patterns
- Direct implementation of complete workflow through single agent
- All workflow components implemented directly

### ‚úÖ Agent Implementation Working
- install-full-workflow-agent executes without errors
- Proper Task tool invocations to sub-agents
- Sequential workflow phases executed correctly
- Parallel installation phase executed

### ‚ùå File System Operations Failing
- No .claude/ directory created
- No .claudio/ directory created  
- No files written to target directory
- Sub-agent execution appears successful but no actual file operations

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The install-full-workflow-agent implements complete workflow directly, but file system operations may have issues:

1. **File Operation Permissions**: Direct implementation may lack write permissions
2. **Path Resolution**: Agent may be resolving paths incorrectly
3. **Tool Usage**: Agent may not be using Write/LS tools properly
4. **Workflow Implementation**: Direct workflow steps may not be executing file operations

## Next Debug Steps Required

1. Test install-full-workflow-agent with explicit file operation verification
2. Test individual Write tool operations to target directory
3. Check sub-agent context passing and parameter handling
4. Validate file system permissions and path resolution

## Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Command orchestration fixed and working
- ‚ùå File system operations still failing
- üîÑ Requires sub-agent level debugging
