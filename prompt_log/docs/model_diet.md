# Model Assignment Implementation Guide for Claudio Agents

This document provides systematic instructions for assigning Claude models (Haiku/Sonnet 4/Opus 4.1) to all 77 Claudio system agents based on task complexity and performance requirements.

**✅ STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - All model assignments successfully deployed across the entire system.

## Model Selection Strategy

Based on Claude's official model guidance:

- **Haiku**: Fast responses, low cost - simple validators, path operations, basic data extraction
- **Sonnet 4**: Balance of intelligence and speed - complex reasoning, code analysis, documentation generation  
- **Opus 4.1**: Highest intelligence - multi-agent orchestration, cross-system analysis, sophisticated reasoning

## Implementation Instructions

### Frontmatter Format
Add this line to each agent's frontmatter section:
```yaml
model: haiku    # or sonnet, or opus
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Add model metadata to all Haiku agents (11 files)
2. **Phase 2**: Add model metadata to all Sonnet 4 agents (~60 files)
3. **Phase 3**: Add model metadata to all Opus 4.1 agents (7 files)
4. **Phase 4**: Update root CLAUDE.md with model selection documentation
5. **Phase 5**: Validate all 78 agents have correct model assignments
6. **Phase 6**: Test critical workflows to ensure proper model functionality
7. **Phase 7**: Content restructuring, agent decomposition, and pseudo-code cleanup

### Phase 7: Complete System Optimization

#### Phase 7A: Agent Size Analysis & Decomposition Planning
- **Analyze file sizes**: Identify commands/agents exceeding 500 lines
- **Design focused sub-agent architecture**: Break complex agents into 50-500 line specialists
- **Plan TodoWrite coordination patterns**: Commands that orchestrate multiple focused agents
- **Model assignment strategy**: Apply appropriate models to new focused agents

#### Phase 7B: Focused Agent Creation
- **Break oversized agents** into focused 50-500 line specialists with single responsibilities
- **Maintain functionality coverage**: Ensure all capabilities preserved across sub-agents
- **Clear agent boundaries**: Each agent has distinct, well-defined responsibility
- **Proper model assignments**: Apply Haiku/Sonnet/Opus to new focused agents based on complexity

#### Phase 7C: Coordinating Command Development
- **Create coordinating commands** that manage multiple focused agents using TodoWrite patterns
- **Implement TodoWrite orchestration**: Task tracking → parallel agent invocation → result consolidation
- **Preserve existing interfaces**: Users still use same commands, now better organized internally
- **Maintain performance**: Leverage parallel execution where possible

#### Phase 7D: Extended Context Organization
- **Create templates.md files** alongside overview.md and troubleshooting.md in extended_context
- **Move code samples** from main files to templates.md in appropriate extended_context categories
- **Establish reference patterns**: Clear linking from agents/commands to extended_context
- **Organize by categories**: workflow/, development/, infrastructure/, documentation/, research/

#### Phase 7E: Pseudo-Code Cleanup (82 files affected)
- **Pattern detection**: Find and catalog all pseudo-code in commands, agents, and extended_context
- **Preserve legitimate code**: Move functional examples to templates.md files
- **Natural language conversion**: Replace pseudo-code templates with descriptive instructions
- **Reference integration**: Update content to point to templates.md for actual code samples

#### Phase 7F: System Validation
- **File size compliance**: Verify all commands/agents are 50-500 lines
- **Functionality preservation**: Test that all workflows still work correctly
- **Reference integrity**: Validate all extended_context links are functional
- **Model assignment coverage**: Ensure all new focused agents have proper model metadata
- **TodoWrite pattern validation**: Confirm coordinating commands work correctly

## Model Assignment Rationale

### Haiku Selection Criteria
- Simple validation (path existence, format checking)
- Basic file operations (directory creation, simple content)
- Minimal reasoning required

### Sonnet 4 Selection Criteria
- Complex code analysis and generation
- Multi-step workflows with decision-making
- Technology stack analysis
- Documentation requiring context understanding

### Opus 4.1 Selection Criteria
- Multi-agent coordination and orchestration
- Cross-system analysis requiring deep understanding
- Complex security analysis with multiple methodologies
- Sophisticated reasoning across multiple domains

## Phase 7 Implementation Example

### Example: Breaking Down Large Discovery Agent

**Before (Oversized Agent)**:
- `discovery-agent.md` (800+ lines) handling all discovery tasks

**After (Focused Architecture)**:
- `/claudio:discovery` command (coordinating via TodoWrite)
- `discovery-structure-agent.md` (200 lines, Sonnet model)
- `discovery-tech-agent.md` (180 lines, Sonnet model) 
- `discovery-integration-agent.md` (150 lines, Sonnet model)
- `discovery-consolidator-agent.md` (120 lines, Sonnet model)

**TodoWrite Coordination Pattern**:
```
1. Command creates todo list for discovery workflow
2. Parallel Task invocations to focused agents
3. Result consolidation and validation
4. Complete discovery document generation
```

## System Architecture Impact
