# Task 3.1 Status: Authentication Test Suite

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 3.1
- **Task Name**: Authentication Test Suite
- **Phase**: Phase 3 - Testing and Security
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Started**: [Waiting for Phase 2 completion]
- **Last Updated**: [Initial status]
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Complete authentication system from Phases 1 and 2
- **Status**: Waiting for Phase 2 completion
- **Coordination**: Will coordinate with Task 3.3 (Integration Testing)
- **Blockers**: Cannot create comprehensive tests without complete system

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] Unit tests for all authentication functions
- [ ] Integration tests for auth workflows
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for authentication code
- [ ] Edge case and error scenario testing
- [ ] Automated test suite CI/CD integration
- [ ] Mock and fixture data created
- [ ] Performance tests for auth operations
- [ ] Test documentation complete

## Implementation Plan
### Phase A: Test Infrastructure Setup (0.15 days)
- [ ] Set up test configuration and coverage reporting
- [ ] Create test fixtures and factory data
- [ ] Configure testing environment
- [ ] Set up mock data patterns

### Phase B: Core Authentication Tests (0.25 days)
- [ ] Unit tests for authentication context functions
- [ ] Controller and LiveView authentication tests
- [ ] Authorization and access control tests
- [ ] Session management tests

### Phase C: Coverage and Integration (0.1 days)
- [ ] Achieve >95% test coverage
- [ ] Integration workflow testing
- [ ] CI/CD integration setup
- [ ] Test documentation and maintenance guide

## Testing Strategy Planning
### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Authentication functions, password hashing, user validation
- **Integration Tests**: Complete auth workflows, session management
- **Controller Tests**: Auth endpoints, error handling, redirects
- **LiveView Tests**: Authentication state, real-time updates
- **Authorization Tests**: Access control, permission validation

## Current Work
**Status**: Ready to begin after Phase 2 completion
**Preparation**: Can review Phoenix testing patterns and set up test infrastructure

## Test Coverage Goals
- Authentication Context: 100% coverage
- Authorization Functions: 100% coverage
- Authentication Controllers: 100% coverage
- Authentication LiveViews: 95% coverage
- Overall Authentication Module: >95% coverage

## Issues and Blockers
- **Phase 2 Dependency**: Need complete authentication system
- **Test Environment**: Need production-like test environment setup
- **Coordination Needed**: Must coordinate with Task 3.3 to avoid duplication

## Quality Standards
- All tests deterministic and reliable
- Fast test execution (<10 seconds for auth suite)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear test descriptions and maintainable code
- Proper mock usage for external dependencies

## Next Steps (after Phase 2 completion)
1. Review complete authentication system implementation
2. Set up comprehensive test infrastructure
3. Create authentication test fixtures and factories
4. Implement unit tests for all authentication functions
5. Create integration tests for complete workflows
6. Achieve and validate >95% test coverage
7. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## Test Scenarios to Implement
### Authentication Scenarios
- User registration with valid/invalid data
- Login with correct/incorrect credentials
- Password hashing and validation
- Session creation and management
- Logout and cleanup processes

### Authorization Scenarios
- Task ownership validation
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Permission checking consistency
- Resource access control
- Error handling for authorization failures

### Edge Cases
- Concurrent authentication attempts
- Session timeout scenarios
- Invalid token handling
- Database constraint violations
- Network failure recovery

## Performance Benchmarks
- Authentication operation response times
- Password hashing performance standards
- Session lookup efficiency metrics
- Database query optimization validation
- Memory usage during authentication

## Coordination Requirements
### Task 3.3 Integration Testing
- Share test data and fixtures
- Coordinate workflow testing scenarios
- Align on testing tool and framework usage
- Share performance benchmark data

### Task 3.2 Security Audit
- Provide security-focused test scenarios
- Validate security vulnerability testing
- Share authentication attack prevention tests

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria met and:
- >95% test coverage achieved and maintained
- All tests passing consistently
- Performance benchmarks documented
- CI/CD integration working
- Test suite maintainable and well-documented

## Success Metrics
- Zero test failures in authentication suite
- Coverage target exceeded (>95%)
- Fast test execution (<10 seconds)
- Comprehensive scenario coverage validated
- CI/CD integration successful
