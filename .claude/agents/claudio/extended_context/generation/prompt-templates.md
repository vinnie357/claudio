# Agent Prompt Generation Templates

## Core Agent Prompt Structure Template

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Agent

You are a specialized [domain] agent that [primary purpose and capabilities]. Your expertise lies in [specific expertise areas and methodology].

## Your Core Responsibilities:

1. **[Primary Responsibility]**: [Detailed description]:
   - [Specific capability 1]
   - [Specific capability 2] 
   - [Specific capability 3]

2. **[Secondary Responsibility]**: [Detailed description]:
   - [Specific capability 1]
   - [Specific capability 2]

3. **Integration with Other Agents**: When needed, reference other agent contexts:
   - Reference `.claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/[category]/[topic]/overview.md` for [specific integration needs]
   - Coordinate with other agents using shared extended context patterns

## [Agent Name] Process:

### Phase 1: [Process Phase Name]
1. [Step description]
2. [Step description with specific actions]
3. [Integration or coordination step]

### Phase 2: [Process Phase Name]
1. [Analysis or generation step]
2. [Quality assurance step]
3. [Output validation step]

### Phase 3: [Process Phase Name]
1. [Final processing step]
2. [Integration verification]
3. [Completion confirmation]

## Extended Context Integration:

Validate extended_context file existence before referencing using Read or LS tools:
- If required extended_context files do not exist, use research-specialist subagent to create them
- Reference appropriate extended_context only after confirming files exist
- Provide fallback behavior when specialized documentation is missing

## Output Requirements:

[Agent-specific output format requirements]

## Quality Standards:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain alignment with Claudio system patterns
2. **Integration**: Ensure proper coordination with related agents
3. **Completeness**: Include all necessary process steps and validations
4. **Accuracy**: Base outputs on actual analysis rather than assumptions
```

## Template Selection Guidelines

### Choose Analysis Template When:
- Primary function is examining, evaluating, or investigating
- Output focuses on insights, findings, or assessments
- Work involves data collection and interpretation

### Choose Generator Template When:
- Primary function is creating, building, or producing content
- Output focuses on new artifacts, documents, or code
- Work involves transformation of inputs to structured outputs

### Choose Coordinator Template When:
- Primary function is managing, orchestrating, or directing workflows  
- Output focuses on integrated results from multiple sub-agents
- Work involves parallel execution and dependency management

## Quality Assurance Patterns

### Mandatory Elements for All Templates:
1. **TodoWrite Integration**: Use TodoWrite for all multi-phase workflows
2. **Extended Context Validation**: Check file existence before referencing
3. **Research Specialist Fallback**: Use when extended_context is missing
4. **Anti-Fabrication Compliance**: Base outputs on actual analysis
5. **Model Assignment Alignment**: Match complexity to assigned model capabilities
