Each subagent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:


Copy
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the subagent should follow.

use these resources to create a custom /command named /gcms
git commit message short should, invoke a custom subagent that is responsible for comparing
the current git status, and suggesting a brief conventional commit message

use these resources to review the current newprompt command, after the analysis update the command and its related sub agents with the following:

a new prompt should now follow the command + sub agent pattern with its extended context stored in the prompts/<newpromptname> folder.
this pattern produces:
.claudio/commands/<newpromptname>.md - the command for invoking the task
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>.md - the sub agent invoked by the command
prompts/<newpromptname>/<newpromptname>.md - extended context made available to sub agent

when creating a new prompt if the new command can do parallel or asynchronous tasks it should create a cordinator sub agent for its work, that manages multiple sub agents to run the command in parallel or asynchronously. this becomes the command + coordinator + [n] sub agents pattern. 

this pattern produces:

.claudio/commands/<newpromptname>.md - the command for invoking the task
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>-coordinator.md - the sub agent invoked by the command, that invokes the requires parallel subagents
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>-sub-agent-1.md - sub agent invoked by the coordinator
.claudio/agents/<newpromptname>-sub-agent-2.md - sub agent invoked by the coordinator
prompts/<newpromptname>/<newpromptname>.md - extended context made available to the relevant sub agent


 
# create the install command

use the /newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /install command 

/install  ( user | project | path )  default project

install claudio - runs the full workflow and includes installing commands and agents ONLY avaliable in project or path mode

install commands - only installs the commands, subagents, and related prompts available in all install types

the related prompts in user mode are placed in ~/.claude/agents/claudio/prompts/<prompt>
in all other modes the prompts are placed in <path | project>/.claudio/prompts/<prompt>

user:

install files to:
~/.claude/commands/claudio/<command>.md
~/.claude/agents/claudio/<command>.md
tell the user the session needs rights in ~/.claude

project:

eg: <project> - assumes current working directory

install files to:
 <project>/.claude/commands/claudio/<command>.md
<project>/.claude/agents/claudio/<command>.md
tell the user the session needs rights in <project>/.claude

path:

eg: /github/mycode/ or ./ - user specified path

install files to:
 <path>/.claude/commands/claudio/<command>.md
<path>/.claude/agents/claudio/<command>.md
tell the user the session needs rights in <path>/.claude

create a validation sub agent for the install, that checks for all relevant files after any install pattern is complete before showing the user a list of what was installed and where.

/install - defaults to project and full workflow

/install commands - defaults to project

/install commands user - installs to ~/ 

/install /path/to/code - runs full workflow and installs commands and agents

/install commands /path/to/code - installs commands only in the specified path


we need to ensure our commands know how to referecne their subagents correctly in folders, as well as their extended prompt context documents

when refrenced by a command the subagent can be called by claudio:<sub agent name> 
when a sub agent is refrencing the extended prompts they have to reference the prompts locations which depends on the install, they can be at <project>/.claudio/prompts/<prompt> or ~/.claude/agents/claudio/prompts<prompt>

ensure the agents follow this pattern

any extended context from the original commands should be moved to their respective prompt location and addressible by the agent

during the process referneces to a generic subagent were created this is incorrect, every command using the command + agent pattern or the command + coordinator sub agent + (n)agents pattern should have its own dedicated subagent defined, and each of those should be able to refrence extended context in the respective prompts folder

# ensure agent access and prompt access

when installing commands, they need to refrence the sub agents in the claudio:<agent-name> format
when used directly they will just be <agent-name>

ensure all commands refrence real sub agents

unifi the location by making them all follow the .claude/claudio/<resource> format, this means moving the existing commands. to match these locations.

.claude/agents/claudio/<agent>
.claude/agents/claudio/prompts/<prompt>
.claude/commands/claudio/<command>


# review the git diff, for commands, and prompts

do a git diff on each command , and each prompt
ensure there is no missing context from the conversion, that should be present in the extended context.

ensure that the install command is using the new unified folder structure for commands prompts and sub agents, the project specific files like docs and tasks will still go to .claudio/

address 
  ⚠️ Minor Context Gaps Identified:

  1. PRD Command: Original command had specific PRD types (feature, enhancement, integration) that should be verified in the prompt
  2. Install Command: Already uses correct claudio:install-coordinator format

review the subagents .claude/agents/claudio/install-* ensure the have the new folder structure when creating agents or commands or prompts

check all the prompts and make sure they are named correctly, and make sure the process that makes new prompts makes the new 
│   names correctly

continue, this makes the format
.claude/agents/claudio/prompts/<prompt>/claude.md

ensure the newprompt command and agents use this new file naming and folder structure

# addtional verification

go one by one through each command, ensure there is a flow from command to agent or agents, and each agent should have access to an extended context in prompts

<!-- # propagation plan

each prompt folder, should contain a readme that would enable someone
to recreate the relevent command and sub agent. 
example file layout:
 prompts/<prompt> - extended detailed examples and instructions for the command and agents
 prompts/readme.md - documentation about the command and its agents to enable recreation -->


# implement command

use the /claudio:newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /claudio:implement command 
command to beging implementing the plan that was created by the claudio workflow
the implement should attempt to do tasks that can be completed in parallel with sub agents

the implement command should not automatically be part of the claudio workflow, users have to invoke it or pass an argument to     │
│   add it to the  workflow



# upgrade command

use the /claudio:newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /claudio:upgrade command
command to take an existing claudio install, and upgrade it with the latest version
it should keep a changelog of the differences so a user can revert if needed without git
if there are no changes inform the user

# readme updates

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

the /claudio command is still using the old refrence the new one is /claudio:claudio

# readme updates x2

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

addtional workflows clarification, the tool is for discovery, planning, and implementation, discovery and planning are combined    │
│   in the default workflow, implementation is optional

# security review command

use the /claudio:newprompt command and its sub agents to create a new /claudio:security-review command
command to do a security review with a stride methodology and product mermaid diagrams to illustrate the findings, by default this is used in the discovery phase of the claudio workflow
users can also invoke the command directly and target a /path/tocode or a "instruction" and the report will be generated for them. it should create any specialist subagents it needs and any addtional specific details in its prompt folder

the outputs should go to <target_project>/.claudio/docs/security/

when used in the claudio workflow the analysis should review any project documentation or .claudio/docs/ documentation or existing project code

# readme updates

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

# extend upgrade

review the claudio:upgrade command, it should by default run the process on the current working directory, but it should also
│   accept a path like /claudio:upgrade /path/to/mycode update the command and the readme to support this.

# test upgrade

/claudio:upgrade examples/web-app

 when installing, the created agents and commands are localized to the project based off of the discovery, never just copied over.  │
│   localization requires discovery outputs, so the new project specific commands and agents are tailored to the specific project.

update the command claudio:update and its agents to reflect this localization process

# test install

ensure the install process follows the same localization process and doesn't simply copy commands and agents

# update docs

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features

when running the install in user mode to ~/
the commands and subagents are copied, and not localized, as there will be no project to discover. this allows the user to inital the localization workflow on a target project of their choice

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features


# better testing

create a test folder, with multiple example projects
one for each imporant workflow
one for install - tests the default claudio:install command that installs the entire localized system
one for upgrade - test the claudio:upgrade command that tests localized upgrade workflow
one for install commands only - tests the claudio:install workflow that only installs the localized commands and subagents
one for discovery - test the claudio:discovery command used directly

each test project folder will have a readme.md related to a sample project

each test project is a folder:
install - just a readme
install-commands - just a readme
upgrade - just a readme and an existing claudio install
discovery-readme - just a readme
discovery-code - a readme and sample code, can be basic elixir phoenix app no postgres

add a readme to test/readme.md that explains all these example project and thier purpose and which commands execute these tests.
sugguest an ordered script to run these tests that would run during continuious intergration testing
the readme should reflect that the example projects were all generated and are not live projects


review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features add a development section if not already present that makes reference to the test folder and its patterns 


# test upgrade command

/claudio:upgrade examples/web-app


# ci allow tool uses

review test/readme.md when in the ci workflow for the test script to not fail it needs to 
have the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag set for its test tasks

the ci test would need to be able to use the claude-sdk through claude  -p "/claudio:install" --dangerously-skip-permissions

the script should also check if claude is installed, and assumes the ci run or local run have an authenticated session with  
│   anthropic or an api token through environment varibles, in the github action it would use a github secret env


# research 12factorapps

/claudio:research software design https://12factor.net/

# discovery issues 

review the /claudio:claudio command, users are reporting that it is anaylyzing itself and not their projects

 /claudio:claudio /path/to/project IMPORTANT: ignore the claudio
directory its not part of the project, it is a tool to enhance the project, you don't need to discuss
this just run the workflow on the target project and install the commands, use the validation agent to
ensure the full workflow has run and the validation agent was successful.

the upgrade process does need to use the `claudio` directory and the `.claudio` directory to update the `.claudio` directory the   │
│   discovery process should only review the `.claudio` directory to see if there is an existing install and use it, the discovery     │
│   process should never use the `claudio` directory, as it is analyzing the target project not itself.

# validation loop not starting

users are also reporting the install coordinator is not calling the install validator when complete this should always be the installs last task

similarlly we want the claudio:claudio command coordinator to run its validation sub agent also

the the primary workflows are :
/claudio:claudio /path/to/project - run the workflow and validate
/claudio:install /path/to/project - run the workflow validate, install the commands and sub agents validate
/claudio:install commands - run the minimum discovery to create the localized commands then validate, then create the commands and subagents based on the discovery and validate


1. /claudio:claudio /path/to/project → run workflow → validate completion
2. /claudio:install /path/to/project → run workflow → validate workflow  → install → validate installation
3. /claudio:install commands → discovery → validate discovery docs → install commands only → validate installation

install commands, should always inlcude their required sub agents, and required extented contect documents in .claude/claudio/prompts

review each validation subagent, ensure they have explict success criteria and report what is missing

# test commands

/claudio:generate-test-commands - creates custom commands with their subagents and extended context in the users target project as /claudio:test and /claudio:test-g

each command, sub agent, and extenxted context, is generated using the context from the project discovery documents

/claudio:test - by default runs the users test suite, and provides a summary, if given a --fix flag it makes a plan to address the issues

/claudio:test-g - is a special agent that requires gemini-cli and gemini access, this command gives explict commands to gemini-cli through a bash tool use `gemini -y -p " {user input} + an explict prompt telling gemini it is in a read only mode, and is able to execute the projects test suite, use playwigh or other mcps where releveant and it ONLY responds in prompts to the claude sub agent that called it, it needs to provide a prompt of the issues found and a task list to address them ONLY, the claude sub agent will review the outputs by default and if the --fix flag is set attempt to fix them.

the generated test comamnds /claudio:test, /claudio:test-g 
are included in the 
/claudio:install /path/to/project
/claudio:upgrade /path/to/project
/claudio:install commands /path/to/project
/claudo:claudio /path/to/project

the /claudio:generate-test-commands command is used to generate the /claudo:test and /claudio:test-g commands that get installed 
upgraded or added to a project. the generate-test-commands command will not be installed upgrade or added to a users .claude directory ensure the validator and other subagents know this

the the /claudio:generate-test-commmands will be run, during a /claudio:install, /claudio:install commands, /claudio:claudio, and /claudio:update

# new command generator

create /claudio:new-command  - the new command generator expects a user to provide a name and a purpose, and either a research document or a URL example 

/claudio:new-command mycommand "does the thing I want" https://mything.information , or mything_readme.md 

if a URL is provided, the sub agent uses the /claudio:research command to generate the extended context files for the command

all new commands will follow our command structure of command, sub agent, extended context.
we can use this as a pattern, and includes validation

if the command needs to be added to the claudio workflow, they can add the --claudio "where it goes in the workflow" to their command like :

/claudio:new-command mycommand "does the thing I want" https://mything.information , or mything_readme.md --claudio "add to after the discovery workflow"

if the --claudio flag is not provided it is a user command and not part of the claudio workflow

#  update docs

review the current readme, the usage and commands have changed, update the read me with the new patterns and features add a development section if not already present that makes reference to the test folder and its patterns

this is incorrect, the agents must be their agent_name.md under .claude/agents/claudio/agent_name.md, and commands
  comamnd_name.md  under .claude/commands/claudio/command_name.md and the prompts prompt_name.md under
  .claude/agents/promopts/prompt_name.md  the validator should also check for this pattern.


# claude is confusing commands and agents

the folder seperation of agent vs command doesn't appear to be enough detail for claude, so we may need to rename the agents to
  include the word agent, so a command would be .claude/commands/claudio/command_name.md, and its corresponding agent would be
  .claude/agents/claudio/command_name_agent.md unless the agent name is distinct from the command name, this prevents the confusion
   for claude, when invoking commands vs invoking agents. we might also rename prompts to
  .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/extented_context_topic.md

  the agent rename plan is good, but we also need to review how agents are invoked the documentation shows "Use the code-reviewer    │
│   subagent to check my recent changes"  in ourcase this would be "Use the claudio:code-reviewer subagent to check my recent    
│   changes" this has no task or tool uses to accomplish it only that the agent is correctly formatted, and its description is   
│   relevant to the task, we must ensure our agent descriptions are sufficently detailed

this plan is good, we also need to address that extended_context/topics could have a folder structure like                   
│   extented_context/category/topic/{overview.md,troubleshooting.md}

the plan is good, step 5 can only be validated in a new session as the agents aren't loaded until a new session starts, so for     │
│   step5 suggest a prompt and write it to test/agent_validation.md so we can use this file in a new session to address what you were  │
│   trying to accomplish in this session

extend the description fields on each agent, they should reference any 


# claude-sdk-architect agent

 use the claude-sdk-architect to review the agent at ~/.claude/agents/claude-sdk-architect.md
   extend the subagent to spawn an agent focused on claude commands, and another focused on
  claude subagents these agents should be able to be used in paralell and they will be used to
   evaulate related commands and subagents in another claude system


 update our /claudio:newprompt command to always invoke parallel tool calls with prompt that   │
│   will always get the parallel workers going. “Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE  
│   message”.  we should update any agents or subagents that refrence subagents with this   
│   pattern


use the claudio-claude-sdk-architect agent to evaulate the newprompt command and its related  │
│   subagents

the new claudio-claude-sdk-arhitect is not spawning subagents which is causing its thread to  │
│   memory leak and crash can we understand why its not starting both of the sub agents?


 ensure any refrences to .claude/agents/claudio/prompts are now refrencing the           
│   .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/category/topic.md pattern

look for other examples of this failure, remember prompts are now extended_context

its no longer an agent prompt, its now the extended_context for that agent following the
│   pattern                                                                                 
│   .claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/category/topic/{overview.md,troubleshooting.md}


ensure that subagents don't continuiously look for their extended_context documents if not
  found they should report that there isn't one, and offer to create one with the
  /claudio:research command

 an invokation of the /claudio:research command requires 3 inputs /claudio:research cataegory
   topic {URL or document}

ensure the agent is only reviewing one command at a time, and one agent at a time if there    │
│   are multiple subagents in the command, spawn multiple subagent alaysis tasks instead of one   │
│   trying to do them all

# test agent updates

 make a new test/claudio-agents with a simple sample web application and readme and update the     
│   test/agent_validation.md to use this when testing, rather than the root .claudio directory   

make it a sample elixir webapp instead     

update readme refrences for development to say this test workflow is invoked by starting a new claude     │

@test/agent_validation.md start the process from phase 5 where it failed last

what phases are remaining for the agent_validation test? 

continue running the test suite until its done  



we need to check the subagent invocation for these: 
new-command-generator
discovery_agent - needs to change to discovery-agent

we saw abritrary tool uses like `claude --agent` and `/new-command-generator`
and `Bash command cd /Users/vinnie/github/claudio && /claudio:claude-sdk --analyze-agent plan_agent ` in phase 7
 instead of the successful agent patterns used in previous phases

we also say the sdk agents invoked in multiple phases is this a duplication?
Phase 8 & 9 Tests: Command vs Agent Disambiguation + Claude SDK Analysis

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/vinnie/github/claudio && echo "Testing command invocation: /claudio:claude-sdk
      --analyze-commands")
  ⎿  Testing command invocation: /claudio:claude-sdk --analyze-commands

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/vinnie/github/claudio && echo "Testing command invocation: /claudio:claude-sdk
      --analyze-agent discovery_agent")
  ⎿  Testing command invocation: /claudio:claude-sdk --analyze-agent discovery_agent

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/vinnie/github/claudio && echo "Testing command invocation: /claudio:claude-sdk
      --cross-system")
  ⎿  Testing command invocation: /claudio:claude-sdk --cross-system

⏺ claudio-claude-sdk-architect(Final comprehensive SDK analysis)
  ⎿  claudio-claude-commands-analyst(Comprehensive command analysis for Claude SDK validation)
     claudio-claude-subagents-analyst(Comprehensive agent architecture analysis for Claude SDK validation)

the phase 8 and 9 test crashed, we need to review how its invoking the sdk agents this version is  broken.

---

each test/folder needs its own mise.toml and proper .gitignore

in the test/claudio-agents settings.local.json allow all tool uses for mix commands

the subagent invocations in tests/agent_validation.md work very successfully, check the claude commands in .claude/commands/ and the claude commands in .claude/commands/claudio/ and ensure these commands follow the same patterns for the multi subagent useage and parallel usage where possible

when the claudio workflow runs, or installs, or updates and localizes commands and agents for a target project we must ensure that the created claude commands and agents ALLWAYS follow these sucessful patterns

check all claude commands for the new pattern, .claude/commands .claude/commands/claudio/  also check any of  │
│   our commands or subagents that produce commands or agents to ALLWAYS use these patterns  

we need to do another check for any of the lowercase_underscore names, and make sure everything is lowercase-hypen

add the lowercase-hypen naming convention as an ALLWAYS to the root claude.md

# re run validation after changes

@test/agent_validation.md

# update documentation

review our current readme and any related documents in docs/ and ensure they follow the new repository patterns for the commands, subagents, and extended_context

update the root claude.md if needed

we need to put the subagent invocation pattern as an always do it this way in the root claude.md
"prompt that will always get the parallel workers going. `Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message`"

parallel task invocation is not always possible we should group workflows that can be, but some workflows     │
are prerequsites for the parallel workflows and must be sequential, when invoking parallel tasks we must use  │
this pattern:                                                                                           
"prompt that will always get the parallel workers going. `Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message`  │
we must also make sure the subagent calling commands pattern is in the root claude.md as an ALLWAYS use 
this pattern when subagents call commands and ensure this patter is used when creating new subagents or 
localiazing them   

update our change log

#
# todo:
#

# model diet

use hakiu where possible for subagent work
use opus where needed for research command
allow research command to think and deep think

prune sub agent context, rely on extended context files more, and sub section them into
general
troubleshooting
specific-topics

we need to instruct every single command and agent to NEVER fabricate information
NEVER fabricate timelines
NEVER fabricate security review contents
NEVER fabricate code quality
NEVER fabricate task status, if a task doesn't have a valid test it is not passing or complete
NEVER add superlatives to descriptions its wasting context


# claudini command

command for claude to use gemini for generic tasks with extended context

# test-g command

command for tests to use gemini-cli to run the tests, and claude to implement the fixes

# enhance parallel with worktrees

 Tip: Use git worktrees to run multiple Claude sessions in parallel. Learn more (https://docs.anthropic.com/s/claude-code-worktrees)

# checkout gpt-5 for planning tasks and command and subagent creation

similar to our gemini workflow that takes advatange of the large context window for research and debugging of gemini

the gpt-5 workflow appears to accell at project planing, requirements documents and prds.
