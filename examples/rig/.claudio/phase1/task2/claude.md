# Task 1.2: Core CLI Framework Agent

You are a specialized agent focused exclusively on completing Task 1.2: Core CLI Framework. Your expertise is tailored to implementing the foundational CLI framework using clap while maintaining awareness of the broader Phase 1 context.

## Task Overview
- **Description**: Implement foundational CLI framework using clap with proper command structure and help system
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 4 days
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Setup)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command-line argument parsing with clap for all documented commands
- [ ] Subcommand structure matching the rig CLI specification
- [ ] Comprehensive help system with usage examples and descriptions
- [ ] Error handling framework with user-friendly, actionable messages
- [ ] Configuration file support (.rigconfig) and environment variable handling
- [ ] Global flags (--verbose, --json, --config) working across all commands

## Required Context
- **Phase Context**: Reference `../claude.md` for phase-level coordination
- **Previous Tasks**: Task 1.1 provides project structure foundation
- **External Resources**: clap documentation, Rust CLI best practices

## Implementation Guidelines

### CLI Framework Architecture
```rust
// src/cli.rs - Command structure
use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "rig")]
#[command(about = "A CLI for managing cloud infrastructure on Max platform")]
pub struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    pub command: Commands,
    
    #[arg(long, global = true)]
    pub verbose: bool,
    
    #[arg(long, global = true)]
    pub json: bool,
    
    #[arg(long, global = true)]
    pub config: Option<PathBuf>,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    Login(LoginArgs),
    Create(CreateArgs),
    Status(StatusArgs),
    // ... other commands
}
```

### Configuration Management
- Implement .rigconfig file support with TOML format
- Environment variable override support (RIG_API_TOKEN, RIG_CONFIG, etc.)
- Hierarchical configuration: CLI flags > env vars > config file > defaults

### Error Handling Framework
- Create structured error types with actionable messages
- Implement user-friendly error display with suggestions
- Include context and recovery guidance in error messages

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: clap 4.x with derive feature for type-safe CLI definition
- **Configuration**: TOML-based config files with serde integration
- **Logging**: env_logger or tracing for debugging and verbose output
- **Error Handling**: thiserror for structured error types with display formatting

## Quality Requirements
- All commands must have comprehensive help text with examples
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
- Configuration loading must be robust with clear fallback behavior
- Code must follow established Rust idioms and project standards

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] CLI structure implemented with all documented commands
- [ ] Help system complete with usage examples
- [ ] Configuration file loading and environment variable support
- [ ] Error handling framework with structured error types
- [ ] Global flags functional across all commands
- [ ] Integration with Task 1.1 project structure
- [ ] Unit tests for CLI parsing and configuration
- [ ] Documentation for CLI usage and configuration

## Integration Points
- **Task 1.1**: Uses project structure and dependencies established
- **Task 1.3**: Provides CLI foundation for authentication commands
- **Future Tasks**: All subsequent commands build on this framework

## Success Metrics
- All rig commands parse correctly with appropriate help text
- Configuration loading works reliably across platforms
- Error messages provide clear guidance for user recovery
- CLI framework supports all documented rig functionality

Focus on creating a robust, extensible CLI foundation that all other features can build upon. The framework should be intuitive for users and maintainable for developers.
