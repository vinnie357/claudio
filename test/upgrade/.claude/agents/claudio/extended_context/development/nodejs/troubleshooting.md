# Node.js Troubleshooting for TaskFlow

## Common Issues

### Express.js API Performance Issues
**Problem**: TaskFlow API endpoints respond slowly under load
**Solution**: Implement connection pooling for databases, use async/await properly, add caching layers, profile API performance

### Memory Leaks in Long-Running Services
**Problem**: Node.js microservices consume increasing memory over time
**Solution**: Monitor event listeners, properly cleanup database connections, use heap profiling tools, implement proper garbage collection

### Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Problem**: PostgreSQL and MongoDB connections exceed pool limits
**Solution**: Configure proper connection pool sizes, implement connection retry logic, monitor connection usage patterns

### WebSocket Connection Management
**Problem**: WebSocket connections for task synchronization become unstable
**Solution**: Implement proper connection cleanup, use WebSocket heartbeat/ping-pong, handle reconnection logic gracefully

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript build failures in microservices development
**Solution**: Configure proper TypeScript project references, resolve dependency type conflicts, use incremental compilation

## Debug Strategies
- Use Node.js built-in debugger or VS Code debugging for API development
- Implement comprehensive logging with structured data for service correlation
- Use npm audit for security vulnerability detection in dependencies
- Profile memory usage with Node.js heap snapshots and analysis tools
- Monitor API performance with request/response timing and throughput metrics

## Getting Help
- Node.js official documentation for performance and debugging
- Express.js guides for API development and middleware patterns
- TaskFlow-specific troubleshooting for microservices architecture
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB Node.js driver documentation
- TypeScript configuration and build optimization resources
