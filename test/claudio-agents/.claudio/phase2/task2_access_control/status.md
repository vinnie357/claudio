# Task 2.2 Status: Access Control Implementation

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 2.2
- **Task Name**: Access Control Implementation
- **Phase**: Phase 2 - Authorization Integration
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 day
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Started**: [Waiting for Task 2.1 completion]
- **Last Updated**: [Initial status]
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Task 2.1 (User-Task Database Association) completion
- **Required**: Phase 1 authentication system functional
- **Status**: Waiting for user-task associations to be established
- **Blockers**: Cannot implement access control without user-task relationships

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] Authorization policy module for task access control
- [ ] Task ownership validation functions
- [ ] Access control plugs for CRUD operations
- [ ] User-scoped task context functions
- [ ] Authorization helpers for controllers/LiveViews
- [ ] Error handling for unauthorized access
- [ ] Integration with authentication system
- [ ] Performance-optimized user-scoped queries

## Implementation Plan
### Phase A: Policy Framework (0.3 days)
- [ ] Create authorization policy module structure
- [ ] Implement core ownership validation functions
- [ ] Design authorization decision framework

### Phase B: Access Control Integration (0.4 days)
- [ ] Create access control plugs for controllers
- [ ] Update task context with user-scoped queries
- [ ] Implement authorization helpers
- [ ] Integrate with authentication pipeline

### Phase C: Security and Performance (0.3 days)
- [ ] Add error handling for authorization failures
- [ ] Optimize database queries for user scoping
- [ ] Comprehensive security testing
- [ ] Performance validation

## Technical Decisions
(To be documented as implementation progresses)

### Authorization Architecture
- Policy pattern vs. simple ownership checks: TBD
- Plug-based vs. context-based authorization: TBD
- Error handling strategy: TBD (redirect vs. 403 vs. 404)

## Current Work
**Status**: Ready to begin after Task 2.1 completion
**Preparation**: Can review Phoenix authorization patterns and design policy structure

## Authorization Strategy
### Multi-Layer Security
1. **Route Protection**: Ensure authenticated user
2. **Resource Authorization**: Verify task ownership
3. **Query Scoping**: User-limited database queries
4. **UI Controls**: Show/hide based on permissions

### Policy Design Considerations
- Centralized vs. distributed authorization logic
- Performance impact of authorization checks
- Maintainability of authorization rules
- Testing strategy for security policies

## Issues and Blockers
- **Task 2.1 Dependency**: Need user-task associations complete
- **Authentication Integration**: Must coordinate with Phase 1 auth system
- **Performance Concerns**: User-scoped queries must be optimized

## Security Requirements
- **Zero Unauthorized Access**: No way to access other users' tasks
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of authorization
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Default deny approach
- **Audit Trail**: Log authorization decisions for security monitoring

## Next Steps (after Task 2.1 completion)
1. Review completed user-task associations from Task 2.1
2. Design authorization policy structure
3. Implement core access control functions
4. Create controller integration plugs
5. Update task context with user-scoped operations
6. Comprehensive security testing

## Quality Gates
- [ ] No unauthorized access possible through any route
- [ ] Authorization consistently applied across all operations
- [ ] Performance impact within acceptable limits
- [ ] Clear error handling for authorization failures
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
- [ ] Security review passed

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Authorization policy functions
- **Integration Testing**: Controller plug functionality
- **Security Testing**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **Performance Testing**: User-scoped query efficiency
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient user-scoped database queries
- Minimize authorization overhead
- Consider caching authorization decisions
- Optimize for common usage patterns

## Integration Points
- Phase 1 authentication system integration
- Existing task context modifications
- Controller and LiveView authorization
- Error handling and user feedback

## Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk**: High (authorization failures could expose data)
- **Performance Risk**: Medium (user-scoped queries need optimization)
- **Integration Risk**: Medium (must not break existing functionality)
- **Testing Complexity**: High (security testing requires comprehensive coverage)

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria met and:
- Complete security audit passed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Integration testing successful
- Ready for Task 2.3 UI integration

## Dependencies for Next Tasks
Upon completion, enables:
- **Task 2.3**: Controller and View Updates (can use authorization functions)
- **Phase 3**: Security testing with complete access control
- Full user-task isolation and security
