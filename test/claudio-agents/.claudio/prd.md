# TaskApp User Authentication System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Transform TaskApp from a single-user demonstration application into a multi-user task management system with secure user authentication, task ownership, and session management while maintaining the existing real-time LiveView architecture and clean separation of concerns.

### Key Objectives
- **Security First**: Implement secure user authentication with industry best practices
- **Seamless Integration**: Add authentication without disrupting existing real-time functionality
- **User Experience**: Maintain the fast, responsive LiveView experience with smooth authentication flows
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure users only access their own tasks through proper authorization
- **API Security**: Secure both LiveView and REST API endpoints with consistent authentication

### Success Definition
A production-ready multi-user task management system where authenticated users can securely manage their personal tasks with real-time updates, proper session management, and comprehensive security controls across all application interfaces.

### Timeline Overview
- **Phase 1 (2-3 weeks)**: Core authentication system implementation
- **Phase 2 (1-2 weeks)**: Task ownership and permissions
- **Phase 3 (1 week)**: API authentication and session management
- **Phase 4 (1 week)**: Security hardening and testing

## Project Context

### Current State
TaskApp is a Phoenix LiveView application with:
- **Single-user architecture**: No user concept or authentication
- **In-memory storage**: GenServer-based TaskStore without persistence
- **Dual interfaces**: LiveView UI and REST API endpoints
- **Real-time capabilities**: Live updates and statistics via Phoenix LiveView
- **Clean architecture**: Proper separation between business logic and web layers

### Problem Statement
**Primary Challenge**: The application currently lacks user authentication and multi-user support, limiting its use to demonstration purposes.

**Specific Issues**:
1. **No user identity**: All tasks are shared globally without ownership
2. **No access control**: Any user can view/modify all tasks
3. **No session management**: No concept of login/logout or user sessions
4. **Security gaps**: Both LiveView and API endpoints are unprotected
5. **Data persistence**: In-memory storage prevents user data retention

### Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive authentication system that:
- Adds user registration and login capabilities using Phoenix built-in authentication
- Introduces task ownership and user-specific data isolation
- Secures both LiveView and REST API endpoints
- Maintains existing real-time functionality for authenticated users
- Migrates to persistent storage to support user data retention

### Business Impact
- **User Adoption**: Enable real-world usage by multiple users
- **Security Compliance**: Meet basic security requirements for user data protection
- **Scalability Foundation**: Prepare for future multi-user features and enterprise usage
- **Demonstration Value**: Showcase complete Phoenix authentication patterns
