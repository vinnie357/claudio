# Discovery Workflow Overview - TaskFlow Specialization

## Purpose
Comprehensive project analysis workflow specialized for TaskFlow Productivity App and cross-platform development with React Native, Node.js, and multi-database architectures.

## Key Analysis Areas

### React Native Mobile Development
- **Project Structure**: Platform-specific directories (ios/, android/), shared components
- **Native Modules**: Custom native integrations and third-party modules
- **Performance**: Bundle size analysis, rendering performance, memory usage
- **Platform Differences**: iOS vs Android implementations and optimizations

### Node.js Backend Analysis
- **Express.js Architecture**: Middleware stack, routing patterns, API design
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL schemas, MongoDB collections, ORM/ODM patterns
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket implementation, Socket.io integration
- **API Design**: RESTful patterns, authentication, rate limiting

### Cross-Platform Coordination
- **Code Sharing**: Shared business logic, utilities, type definitions
- **Development Workflow**: Synchronized mobile and backend development
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing across platforms
- **Deployment**: CI/CD for mobile apps and backend services

### TaskFlow-Specific Patterns
- **Task Management**: CRUD operations, task hierarchies, completion tracking
- **Synchronization**: Real-time updates, conflict resolution, offline support
- **User Experience**: Mobile-first design, cross-device consistency
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning for task estimation and optimization

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Structure Discovery
1. Map React Native project structure and platform-specific code
2. Analyze Node.js backend organization and API endpoints
3. Identify shared code and cross-platform utilities
4. Detect database schemas and data models

### Phase 2: Technology Deep Dive
1. React Native version and dependency analysis
2. Express.js middleware and routing evaluation
3. Database usage patterns (PostgreSQL + MongoDB)
4. Real-time synchronization implementation assessment

### Phase 3: Architecture Evaluation
1. Monolithic vs microservices architecture analysis
2. Mobile-web-desktop client coordination
3. Data synchronization and conflict resolution
4. Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### Phase 4: Recommendations
1. Performance improvements for mobile and backend
2. Architecture evolution opportunities (microservices migration)
3. Enhanced AI/ML integration possibilities
4. Development workflow optimizations

## Output Format

### Executive Summary
- TaskFlow project overview and core functionality
- Technology stack assessment with version details
- Architecture pattern evaluation (monolithic API + multi-client)
- Development maturity and optimization opportunities

### Detailed Analysis
- **Mobile**: React Native setup, platform support, performance characteristics
- **Backend**: Node.js API design, database usage, synchronization mechanisms
- **Integration**: Cross-platform code sharing, development workflow efficiency
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized improvements for productivity and scalability

This workflow ensures comprehensive analysis tailored to TaskFlow's specific architecture and development needs.
