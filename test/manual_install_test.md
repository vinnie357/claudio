# Manual Install Test Results

## Test Date: August 11, 2024
## Test Command: Full workflow install to test/install

## Pre-Test State
- Target directory: test/install/
- Existing files: README.md, mise.toml, .gitignore, test-file.txt
- No .claude/ or .claudio/ directories present

## Install Coordinator Agent Test Results

### ‚úÖ Task Tool Pattern Fixes Applied
- Fixed install-coordinator-agent.md Task tool usage
- Replaced `claudio:install-system-installer` with `Use Task tool with subagent_type: "install-system-installer"`
- Replaced `claudio:install-validator` with `Use Task tool with subagent_type: "install-validator"`
- All agent name fields validated and matching

### ‚úÖ Agent Coordination Working
- install-coordinator-agent executes without errors
- Proper Task tool invocations to sub-agents
- Sequential workflow phases executed correctly
- Parallel installation phase executed

### ‚ùå File System Operations Failing
- No .claude/ directory created
- No .claudio/ directory created  
- No files written to target directory
- Sub-agent execution appears successful but no actual file operations

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The install-coordinator-agent successfully invokes sub-agents with Task tool, but the sub-agents themselves may have issues:

1. **File Operation Permissions**: Sub-agents may lack write permissions
2. **Path Resolution**: Sub-agents may be resolving paths incorrectly
3. **Tool Usage**: Sub-agents may not be using Write/LS tools properly
4. **Context Passing**: Required context may not be reaching sub-agents

## Next Debug Steps Required

1. Test install-system-installer agent directly with explicit file operations
2. Test individual Write tool operations to target directory
3. Check sub-agent context passing and parameter handling
4. Validate file system permissions and path resolution

## Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Command orchestration fixed and working
- ‚ùå File system operations still failing
- üîÑ Requires sub-agent level debugging
