## Architecture Overview

### Pattern
**Event-Driven Architecture with LiveView Pattern**
- Server-side rendered reactive components
- GenServer-based state management
- Real-time WebSocket communication through Phoenix channels
- Separation of concerns: business logic, web layer, and state management

### Structure
```
lib/
├── task_app/                 # Core business logic layer
│   ├── application.ex       # OTP application supervisor
│   ├── task.ex             # Domain entity with validation
│   └── task_store.ex       # GenServer state management
└── task_app_web/           # Web presentation layer  
    ├── controllers/        # REST API endpoints
    ├── live/              # LiveView interfaces
    ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
    └── layouts/          # Page templates
```

**Clean Architecture Principles:**
- Domain logic isolated in `task_app/` module
- Web concerns separated in `task_app_web/` module
- State management through supervised GenServer processes
- Clear separation between API and LiveView interfaces

### Data Layer
**In-Memory State with GenServer**
- GenServer-based TaskStore for demonstration purposes
- No external database dependencies (intentional design choice)
- Process-isolated state management with fault tolerance
- Concurrent access handling through GenServer message passing

**Production Considerations Noted:**
- README explicitly mentions Ecto + PostgreSQL for production use
- Current architecture facilitates easy migration to persistent storage
- State structure designed for eventual database mapping

### API Design
**Hybrid REST + LiveView Architecture**
- Primary interface through Phoenix LiveView (real-time web UI)
- Complete REST API for external integrations
- Consistent data layer shared between both interfaces
- RESTful endpoints: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE with proper HTTP status codes

## Development Workflow

### Build Process
**Mix-based with Asset Pipeline**
- `mix setup` - Complete development environment setup
- `mix assets.*` - Asset compilation and management  
- `mix phx.server` - Development server with live reloading
- Hot code reloading for rapid development iteration

### Testing
**Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic (Task entity, validation)
- **Integration Tests**: GenServer state management (TaskStore) 
- **Load Tests**: Concurrent access patterns
- **Property-based Testing**: Validation rules with StreamData
- **Coverage Reporting**: ExCoveralls integration

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- ExUnit with concurrent execution
- ExMachina for test data factories
- Mock for dependency isolation
- Floki for HTML assertion testing
- Stream data for property-based testing

### Development Tools
**Quality Assurance Pipeline**
- **Credo** - Static code analysis with strict rules
- **Dialyzer** - Type checking and bug detection
- **ExCoveralls** - Test coverage reporting
- **Mix Format** - Code formatting standardization
- **CI alias** - Complete validation pipeline

### CI/CD
**Development-Ready Pipeline**
- Format checking with `mix format --check-formatted`
- Dependency validation with unused dependency checks
- Static analysis with Credo strict mode
- Test execution with coverage reporting
- Modular CI pipeline through Mix aliases
