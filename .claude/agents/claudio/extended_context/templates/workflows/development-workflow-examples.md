# Development Workflow Examples

This document provides comprehensive examples of development workflow patterns used throughout the Claudio system for code development, quality assurance, and project management.

## Code Quality Assessment Workflow

### Basic Quality Analysis Pattern
```markdown
## Code Quality Assessment Implementation

I will use TodoWrite to track progress, then analyze code quality:

Use TodoWrite to start code quality assessment.

1. **Project Analysis and Tool Detection**:
   Analyze project structure to identify languages, frameworks, and existing quality tools. Configure appropriate linters, formatters, and static analysis tools.

2. **Quality Analysis Execution**:
   Execute detected quality tools (ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, etc.) and collect metrics on code coverage, complexity, and maintainability indicators.

3. **Results Analysis and Reporting**:
   Generate comprehensive quality report with actionable improvement recommendations and prioritized technical debt assessment.

Use TodoWrite to complete code quality assessment.

**Tools Executed**: Project-specific linters and analyzers based on detected technology stack
```

## Security Review Workflow

### Comprehensive Security Assessment Pattern
```markdown
## Security Review Implementation

I will use TodoWrite to track progress, then make parallel Task calls:

Use TodoWrite to start comprehensive security review.

**ðŸš€ CRITICAL: Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message**
- Task with subagent_type: "vulnerability-assessment-specialist" - pass the project path for vulnerability scanning and analysis
- Task with subagent_type: "security-architecture-analyst" - pass the architecture review parameters for design security assessment
- Task with subagent_type: "security-threat-modeler" - pass the STRIDE methodology parameters for threat modeling
- Task with subagent_type: "security-diagram-generator" - pass the threat visualization requirements for diagram creation

Then read outputs from all security specialists, validate completeness, and create comprehensive security assessment report.

Use TodoWrite to complete comprehensive security review.

**Performance Benefits**: Complete security review in ~3-4 minutes vs 12-15 minutes sequential, parallel expert analysis with STRIDE methodology
```

## Testing and Validation Workflow

### Project Testing Pattern
```markdown
## Testing Workflow Implementation

I will use TodoWrite to track progress, then execute testing workflow:

Use TodoWrite to start project testing analysis.

1. **Framework Detection**: Identify testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, ExUnit, Go test) and project structure
2. **Test Execution**: Run appropriate test commands based on detected framework with coverage analysis
3. **Result Analysis**: Parse test outputs, identify failures, and generate actionable summary with fix recommendations

Use TodoWrite to complete project testing analysis.

**Conditional Logic**:
- If package.json with Jest detected â†’ Use Jest-specific testing patterns
- If requirements.txt with pytest â†’ Use Python testing patterns  
- If mix.exs detected â†’ Use ExUnit testing patterns
- Otherwise â†’ Use generic project-test-runner
```

### Test-Driven Development Workflow
```markdown
## TDD Workflow Pattern

**Red-Green-Refactor Implementation**:

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for new functionality
   - Use TodoWrite to track test creation progress
   - Generate test templates based on detected testing framework
   - Validate tests fail as expected before implementation

2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Execute tests continuously during implementation
   - Focus on making tests pass with minimal code changes
   - Track implementation progress with TodoWrite phases

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage
   - Run quality analysis to identify refactoring opportunities
   - Execute full test suite after each refactor step
   - Generate final quality and coverage report
```

## Design and Architecture Workflow

### Design System Analysis Pattern
