# Dark Mode Implementation Plan
## TaskApp Phoenix LiveView Application

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
This implementation plan details the addition of comprehensive dark mode functionality to the TaskApp Phoenix LiveView application. The project will implement a user-toggleable dark mode system that persists user preferences and provides a seamless experience across all application interfaces.

### Timeline Summary
- **Total Duration**: 4 weeks (28 days)
- **Major Milestones**: 5 phases with clear deliverables
- **Key Milestone**: Functional dark mode toggle by Week 2
- **Final Delivery**: Complete dark mode system with user persistence by Week 4

### Resource Summary
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Key Skills**: Phoenix LiveView, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Elixir
- **External Dependencies**: No additional external services required

### Risk Summary
- **Low Risk**: Building on existing Tailwind dark mode foundation
- **Medium Risk**: User preference persistence across sessions
- **Mitigation**: Incremental implementation with fallback strategies

## Project Scope and Approach

### Implementation Strategy
The dark mode implementation follows a progressive enhancement approach, building on the existing Tailwind CSS dark mode classes already present in the codebase. The strategy prioritizes user experience with seamless toggling, system preference detection, and persistent user choices.

### Development Methodology
- **Agile Approach**: Iterative development with working features after each phase
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing for both light and dark modes
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure graceful degradation if JavaScript is disabled

### Quality Assurance
- **Visual Testing**: Manual testing across different browsers and devices
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG 2.1 compliance for both color schemes
- **Performance Testing**: Minimal impact on application load times
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive LiveView interaction testing

### Deployment Strategy
- **Feature Flag**: Dark mode toggle can be disabled if issues arise
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phase-wise deployment with monitoring
- **Fallback Strategy**: Default to light mode if preferences fail to load
