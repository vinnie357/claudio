### Installation Workflow Enhancement
**Before**: Silent system setup with no user guidance
```bash
/claudio:install
# Creates .claude/ and .claudio/ directories
# User left to discover capabilities independently
```

**After**: Educational installation with immediate project guidance
```bash
/claudio:install
# Creates .claude/ and .claudio/ directories
# Generates project-specific CLAUDE.md with:
# - Technology stack analysis and framework-specific guidance
# - Available commands with project-specific examples
# - Recommended workflows based on discovered architecture  
# - Team onboarding information for immediate productivity
```

### Upgrade Workflow Enhancement
**Before**: Component updates without user communication
```bash
/claudio:upgrade
# Updates system components
# User unaware of new capabilities
```

**After**: Upgrade with capability communication
```bash
/claudio:upgrade  
# Updates system components
# Refreshes CLAUDE.md with:
# - New command capabilities and usage examples
# - Updated technology-specific workflows
# - Enhanced integration guidance
# - Preserved user content with fresh Claudio sections
```
