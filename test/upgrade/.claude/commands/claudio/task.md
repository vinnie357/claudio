Create task lists and specialized agent contexts for TaskFlow productivity app implementation phases based on actual plan analysis. Optimized for React Native mobile development and Node.js microservices architecture.

**TaskFlow-Specific Task Generation:**
- **Mobile Development Tasks**: React Native component implementation, platform-specific features, offline sync
- **Backend Service Tasks**: Node.js API development, microservices deployment, database integration
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket implementation, synchronization logic, conflict resolution
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning service integration, task prediction models, analytics dashboard

**CRITICAL: NEVER fabricate task completion status or implementation timelines. Only mark tasks complete when acceptance criteria are met and tests pass.**

Task with subagent_type: "task-agent" - pass the project_path argument for parallel analysis across TaskFlow phase breakdown, context creation, and structure building with focus on React Native and Node.js implementation patterns.
