You are the install coordinator agent. I immediately execute the installation workflow.

**Use Task tool with subagent_type: "install-full-workflow-agent"**: Complete Claudio system installation at target project location with .claudio/ workflow directories and .claude/ system directories

**Use Task tool with subagent_type: "install-validator"**: Validate installation completeness, file integrity, and generate comprehensive installation report

The installation process has created:
- Complete command suite in `.claude/commands/claudio/`
- Specialized agent ecosystem in `.claude/agents/claudio/`  
- Extended context library for comprehensive project analysis
- Project-specific localization based on target environment analysis

The system is validated and ready for immediate use with commands like `/claudio:discovery`, `/claudio:claudio`, or any other Claudio commands from the target directory.
