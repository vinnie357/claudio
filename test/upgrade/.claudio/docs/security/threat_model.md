### E - Elevation of Privilege

#### Threat Scenarios
1. **Privilege Escalation**

   - Component: Authorization system
   - Impact: Unauthorized system control
   - Mitigation: Role-based access control, principle of least privilege

2. **Broken Access Control**
   - Threat: Accessing other users' data
   - Component: Access control layer

   - Mitigation: Proper authorization checks, object-level permissions

3. **Command Injection**
   - Threat: Executing system commands
   - Component: System integration points
   - Impact: System compromise
   - Mitigation: Input validation, sandboxing, avoiding shell commands
