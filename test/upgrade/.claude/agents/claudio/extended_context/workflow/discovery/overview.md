# Discovery Context for TaskFlow Productivity App

## Project-Specific Guidance
Based on discovery analysis, this project uses React Native, Node.js microservices, PostgreSQL, and advanced AI integration with TensorFlow.

## Recommended Approaches
- **React Native Analysis**: Focus on cross-platform component patterns, offline capabilities, and platform-specific optimizations
- **Microservices Architecture**: Analyze service boundaries, API contracts, and event-driven patterns
- **AI Integration Patterns**: Examine ML model integration, TensorFlow service patterns, and productivity analytics

## Integration Patterns
Discovery should analyze:
- React Native project structure and platform-specific implementations
- Node.js Express API services with microservices decomposition
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB database integration patterns
- WebSocket real-time synchronization architecture
- CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions for mobile deployment

## Quality Standards
- Cross-platform compatibility validation for React Native
- API service integration testing between microservices
- Database performance analysis for PostgreSQL queries
- AI model accuracy and performance benchmarking
- Offline-first architecture validation

## Next Steps
- Analyze React Native component architecture and state management
- Review microservices communication patterns and service boundaries
- Examine AI/ML integration points and model deployment strategies
- Validate real-time synchronization and conflict resolution mechanisms
