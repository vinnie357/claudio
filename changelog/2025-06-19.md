3. **Documentation Command** (`/documentation`)
   - Usage: `/documentation <doc_type> [project_path]`
   - Types: readme, api, user, developer, full
   - Output: `docs/` (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/docs/` (within Claudio)

4. **PRD Command** (`/prd`)
   - Usage: `/prd <prd_type> <project_name> [additional_context]`
   - Types: feature, enhancement, integration, migration, full
   - Output: `prd/documents/<project>_prd.md` (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/prd.md` (within Claudio)

6. **Task Command** (`/task`)
   - Usage: `/task <plan_file_path> [project_name]`
   - Creates phase and task contexts based on complexity
   - Output: Directory structure (direct) or `<target>/.claudio/phases/` (within Claudio)

7. **Claudio Master Command** (`/claudio`)
   - Usage: `/claudio <target_project_path>`
   - Executes complete workflow: discovery → PRD → plan → tasks
   - Creates comprehensive `.claudio/` folder in target project

## Key Features Implemented

### Dual Output Strategy
- **Direct Commands**: Save to project-specific directories when run standalone
- **Claudio Workflow**: All outputs organized in target project's `.claudio/` folder
- **Context Integration**: Agents reference each other's contexts when needed

### Context Management
- **Simple Phases (≤2 tasks)**: Single phase context file
- **Complex Phases (>2 tasks)**: Phase context + individual task contexts
- **Shared Resources**: Common utilities and standards contexts
- **Cross-References**: Proper linking between related contexts

### Project Structure
Created organized folder structure:
```
claudio/
├── prompts/              # Agent prompt contexts
├── .claude/commands/     # Executable commands
