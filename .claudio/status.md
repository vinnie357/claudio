- **Features**:
  - JavaScript event listener for `phx:update_theme` events
  - localStorage persistence for user preferences
  - System preference detection for initial theme
  - Dynamic `dark` class application to html element

#### 4. **Enhanced UI Consistency**
- **Improvements**: Added transition animations to all theme-aware components

- **Performance**: Smooth 200ms color transitions throughout interface

### Technical Excellence Demonstrated

#### **Minimal Impact Approach** âœ…
- Leveraged all existing dark mode CSS classes without modification
- Added only essential functionality for theme switching
- Maintained 100% backwards compatibility with existing features
- Zero breaking changes to existing task management functionality

#### **Clean Architecture Patterns** âœ…
- Proper separation of concerns between LiveView state and client-side DOM manipulation
- Event-driven communication using Phoenix LiveView push_event pattern
- Graceful degradation for JavaScript-disabled environments
- Session-based persistence with localStorage enhancement

#### **User Experience Focus** âœ…
- Intuitive toggle button placement in header
- Clear visual feedback with appropriate icons (sun/moon)
- Smooth animations prevent jarring theme transitions
- Accessibility considerations with descriptive tooltips

### Implementation Workflow Capabilities Demonstrated âœ…

#### **1. Phoenix/Elixir Project Understanding**
- Successfully analyzed existing LiveView architecture
- Identified optimal integration points for new functionality
- Maintained idiomatic Elixir/Phoenix patterns throughout implementation
- Leveraged Phoenix LiveView event system effectively

#### **2. Task Coordination and Sequencing**
- Coordinated changes across multiple files (LiveView, layouts, routing)
- Maintained proper dependency order between client and server code
- Ensured consistent state management across LiveView lifecycle
- Successfully integrated with existing task management workflows

#### **3. Quality Implementation Standards**
- Created comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- Maintained clean, readable code with proper documentation
- Followed Phoenix and LiveView best practices consistently
- Implemented proper error handling and edge case consideration

#### **4. Progressive Enhancement Approach**
- Built upon existing CSS framework without disruption
- Added functionality in layers (state â†’ UI â†’ client interaction)
- Maintained graceful fallbacks for various browser environments
- Focused on core functionality over complex features
