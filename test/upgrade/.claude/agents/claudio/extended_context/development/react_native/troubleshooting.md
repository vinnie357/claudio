# React Native Troubleshooting for TaskFlow

## Common Issues

### Cross-Platform Rendering Inconsistencies
**Problem**: TaskFlow UI components render differently on iOS vs Android
**Solution**: Use Platform-specific styling, test on both platforms, implement platform detection for critical UI differences

### Offline Synchronization Conflicts
**Problem**: Task data conflicts when syncing after offline usage
**Solution**: Implement conflict resolution strategies, use timestamps and version numbers, provide user-friendly merge interfaces

### Performance Issues with Large Task Lists
**Problem**: App becomes sluggish with extensive task histories
**Solution**: Implement FlatList virtualization, pagination for task lists, and lazy loading for task details

### WebSocket Connection Management
**Problem**: Real-time updates fail intermittently on mobile networks
**Solution**: Implement connection retry logic, fallback to polling, and proper connection state management

### Memory Leaks in Task Management
**Problem**: App memory usage grows over time during extended task management sessions
**Solution**: Properly cleanup listeners, optimize component unmounting, and monitor memory usage with profiling tools

## Debug Strategies
- Use React Native Debugger for component hierarchy analysis
- Implement Flipper integration for network and database debugging
- Use React Native performance profiler for identifying bottlenecks
- Test offline scenarios with network simulation tools
- Monitor memory usage patterns during extended task management sessions
