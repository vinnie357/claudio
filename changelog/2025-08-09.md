- **Impact**: Users can follow documentation examples without pattern mismatches

### Critical Workflow and Integration Patterns Added
- **Location**: CLAUDE.md Quick Reference, dedicated sections, and Important Instructions
- **Sequential vs Parallel Workflow**: Added proper dependency management guidance
  - Sequential Prerequisites: Discovery → PRD → Planning (must be sequential)
  - Parallel Batches: After prerequisites, use `Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message`
  - Benefits: 3-4x performance improvement while respecting data dependencies
- **Subagent Command Invocation Pattern**: Added mandatory Task tool pattern
  - Required: `Use Task tool with subagent_type: "agent-name" to [action] [context]`
  - Forbidden: Direct `/claudio:command` references in subagents
  - Benefits: Prevents bash execution errors, ensures proper tool usage
  - Scope: MANDATORY for all new subagents and localization processes
- **Quick Reference Updates**: All three critical patterns now prominently displayed
- **Impact**: Users have clear guidance for optimal performance and reliable integration

### Critical Invalid Tool Usage Pattern Fix - SYSTEM-WIDE
- **Issue Identified**: 10 agent files contained invalid `/claudio:research` command references causing Bash execution failures
- **Root Cause**: Subagents were attempting to execute slash commands via Bash tool instead of using Task tool with research-specialist subagent
- **Systematic Fix Applied to All Affected Agents**:
  - `task-agent.md`, `discovery-agent.md`, `prd-agent.md`, `plan-agent.md`
  - `design-analyzer.md`, `code-quality-analyzer.md`, `claudio-coordinator-agent.md`
  - `new-command-generator.md`, `documentation-coordinator.md`
  - `extended_context/claudio/upgrade-troubleshooting.md`
- **Pattern Replacement**:
  - **FROM**: `suggest using '/claudio:research workflow task URL'`
  - **TO**: `use Task tool with subagent_type: "research-specialist" to research patterns from URL`
- **Validation**: Tested 4 fixed agents (task, discovery, prd, design) - all working correctly
- **Impact**: Eliminated all invalid Bash command execution attempts system-wide
- **Location**: Added after "Getting Help" section for easy discovery

## Updates During Session
### Documentation Structure
- Created new `docs/troubleshooting/` directory structure
- Established pattern for future troubleshooting documentation

- Offered scalable solutions from quick fixes to enterprise-grade agent pooling

### Critical Bug Fix: Claude SDK Architect Agent
- **Issue**: `claudio-claude-sdk-architect` agent was causing memory leaks and thread crashes
- **Root Cause**: Agent contained incorrect Task tool invocation instructions with pseudo-syntax
- **Fix Attempt 1**: Replaced manual Task tool coordination with automatic delegation language (unsuccessful)
- **Fix Attempt 2**: Added explicit Task tool usage instructions following working coordinator patterns
- **Fix Attempt 3 (FINAL)**: Added the critical missing instruction for parallel execution
- **Final Changes Made**:
  - Removed invalid `Task(agent-name)` pseudo-syntax examples
  - Added explicit "launch both analysis sub-agents in parallel using the Task tool" instructions
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Added "Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message" instruction
  - Provided concrete Task tool invocation examples with proper parameters
  - Updated workflow to match successful coordinator agents (security-review-coordinator, documentation-coordinator)
  - Added clear Task tool execution guidelines and parallel analysis patterns with single-message requirement
- **Impact**: Should eliminate memory leaks and enable proper sub-agent spawning for Claude SDK analysis tasks

### System-Wide Parallel Execution Fix
- **Issue**: Multiple coordinator agents across the system were missing the critical parallel execution instruction
- **Root Cause**: Coordinator agents had general parallel instructions but lacked the specific "Run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message" pattern
- **System-Wide Fix Applied to**:
  - `/claudio:newprompt` command - Added critical instruction for users
  - `newprompt-coordinator` agent - Updated execution guidelines
  - `security-review-coordinator` agent - Updated execution guidelines  
  - `documentation-coordinator` agent - Updated both individual and full suite workflows
  - `claudio_coordinator_agent` agent - Updated parallel workflow execution
  - `install_coordinator_agent` agent - Updated parallel installation phase
  - `claude-sdk-architect` agent - Previously fixed with comprehensive examples
- **Terminology Update**: Changed "sub-agents" to "subagents" for consistency
- **Impact**: All coordinator agents now have the critical instruction needed for proper parallel subagent execution, eliminating memory leaks and thread crashes system-wide

### Memory Leak Prevention and Extended Context Fixes
- **Critical Issue**: Identified memory leaks caused by agents continuously searching for non-existent extended context files
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - `claude-commands-analyst.md:6` and `claude-subagents-analyst.md:6` had `extended_context` frontmatter causing automatic context loading
  - Multiple agents referenced obsolete `prompts/` structure paths that no longer exist
  - `newprompt-coordinator.md` and related sub-agents referenced non-existent `/prompts/newprompt/claude.md`

#### System-Wide Path Structure Fixes
- **Pattern Migration**: Updated all references from `prompts/` to `extended_context/` structure
- **Path Updates Applied**:
  - `prompts/discovery/claude.md` → `extended_context/workflow/discovery/overview.md`
  - `prompts/plan/claude.md` → `extended_context/workflow/planning/overview.md`
  - `prompts/task/claude.md` → `extended_context/workflow/task/overview.md`
  - `prompts/design/claude.md` → `extended_context/development/design/overview.md`
  - `prompts/code-quality/claude.md` → `extended_context/development/code_quality/overview.md`
  - `prompts/prd/claude.md` → `extended_context/workflow/prd/overview.md`
  - `prompts/documentation/claude.md` → `extended_context/documentation/overview.md`

#### Graceful Extended Context Handling
- **Enhancement**: Added graceful failure handling for missing extended context across all key workflow agents
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Agents now stop searching immediately when context files don't exist
- **Pattern Applied**: Added "If neither exists" fallback with specific research command suggestions using proper 3-parameter format
- **Agents Updated with Research Commands**:
  - `task_agent.md` → `/claudio:research workflow task https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management`
  - `discovery_agent.md` → `/claudio:research workflow discovery https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html`
  - `design-analyzer.md` → `/claudio:research development design https://www.nngroup.com/articles/`
  - `code-quality-analyzer.md` → `/claudio:research development code_quality https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/`
  - `documentation-coordinator.md` → `/claudio:research documentation overview https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/`
  - `claudio_coordinator_agent.md` → `/claudio:research workflow coordination https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/project-management-intro`

#### Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added new "Graceful Context Handling" section documenting resilient operation and self-healing capabilities
- **System Architecture**: Enhanced agent communication patterns with graceful degradation section
- **Research Command Format**: Corrected all research suggestions to use proper 3-parameter format with authoritative URLs

- **Benefits**: 
  - **Memory Efficient**: Eliminated continuous searching for non-existent files preventing memory leaks and crashes
  - **Resilient Operation**: Agents continue functioning when extended context is incomplete
  - **Self-Healing System**: Users receive actionable guidance with authoritative sources to create missing documentation
  - **User Experience**: Clear research commands with proper URLs guide context creation

### Claude SDK Architect Sequential Analysis Fix
- **Issue**: Claude SDK architect was causing crashes due to recursive loops and parallel overload when analyzing complex commands
- **Root Cause**: Agent had mandatory "MUST ALWAYS" parallel execution patterns that created infinite recursion loops
- **Sequential Analysis Implementation**:
  - **Single Command Focus**: Changed workflow to analyze ONE command at a time (prevents system overload)
  - **Individual Subagent Analysis**: Creates separate Task invocations for EACH subagent instead of bulk analysis
  - **Step-by-Step Process**: Command analysis first, then individual subagent analysis, then synthesis
  - **Recursive Loop Prevention**: Removed "MUST BE USED PROACTIVELY" language from analysis agent descriptions

#### Agent Updates Applied
- **`claude-sdk-architect.md`**: 
  - Line 64: "MUST ALWAYS" → "can launch when appropriate"
  - Line 69: "DEFAULT BEHAVIOR" → "ANALYSIS APPROACH" with conditional logic
  - Line 83: "ALWAYS launch" → "When complex analysis is needed"
  - Replaced parallel execution pattern with sequential workflow focusing on one command
- **`claude-commands-analyst.md`**: Removed "MUST BE USED PROACTIVELY" from description
- **`claude-subagents-analyst.md`**: Removed "MUST BE USED PROACTIVELY" from description

#### Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated Claude Code Development section with sequential analysis explanation
- **System Architecture**: Enhanced Claude SDK Analysis Flow with sequential workflow documentation
- **Pattern Change**: From parallel bulk analysis to focused sequential analysis preventing memory issues

#### Benefits
- **System Stability**: Eliminates crashes from recursive loops and parallel overload
- **Focused Analysis**: Better quality evaluation by analyzing one component at a time
- **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents system resource exhaustion from simultaneous complex tasks
- **Scalability**: Approach works regardless of number of subagents in a command

### Upgrade Orchestrator Agent Critical Issues Resolution
- **Issue**: upgrade_orchestrator_agent was missing critical troubleshooting extended context and had incomplete Task coordination documentation
- **Analysis Result**: Agent scored 4.2/5.0 overall but had significant gaps in error recovery capabilities
- **Critical Fixes Applied**:
