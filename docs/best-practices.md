# Claudio Best Practices

[← Back to Main Documentation](../CLAUDE.md)

## Purpose
This document provides development workflows, context management strategies, and integration guidance for effective use of the Claudio system. Use this when you want to optimize your development process and follow established patterns.

## Command Usage Strategies

### Using Individual Commands

#### When to Use Standalone Commands
- **Specific, Focused Tasks**: When you need targeted analysis or generation
- **Iterative Development**: Building documentation and plans incrementally
- **Fine-Grained Control**: When you want to control each step of the process
- **Experimentation**: Testing different approaches and techniques
- **Component Updates**: Updating specific parts of existing documentation

#### Standalone Command Best Practices
```bash
# Start with discovery to understand current state
/claudio:discovery ./project

# Research before implementing new technologies
/claudio:research backend microservices-patterns

# Create focused requirements for specific features
/claudio:prd feature user-authentication

# Plan with realistic time estimates
/claudio:plan feature user-authentication "4 weeks"

# Break complex plans into actionable tasks
/claudio:task plan/documents/user-authentication_implementation_plan.md
```

#### Standalone Command Workflows
- **Research-Driven Development**: Research → PRD → Plan → Task
- **Documentation-First**: Discovery → Documentation → PRD → Plan
- **Incremental Analysis**: Discovery → Research → Enhanced Discovery
- **Feature-Focused**: Research → PRD → Plan → Task → Implementation

### Using Claudio Comprehensive Workflow

#### When to Use Complete Workflow
- **New Project Analysis**: Starting fresh analysis of existing codebases
- **Major Feature Development**: Implementing significant new capabilities
- **System Modernization**: Upgrading or refactoring existing systems
- **Team Onboarding**: Creating shared understanding and context
- **Complete Documentation**: Establishing comprehensive project documentation

#### Comprehensive Workflow Best Practices
```bash
# Use for complete project transformation
/claudio:claudio ../my-project

# Ensure proper directory permissions first
# Verify target project is accessible
# Allow sufficient time for complete analysis
```

#### Workflow Optimization Strategies
- **Clean Target Directory**: Ensure target has proper structure
- **Sufficient Resources**: Allow adequate time and computational resources
- **Review Generated Content**: Validate all outputs before proceeding
- **Integrate with Existing Process**: Align with current development workflow

## Context Management Best Practices

### Extended Context Organization

#### Directory Structure Guidelines
- **Logical Categorization**: Group related contexts by domain
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming patterns
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Maintain clear parent-child relationships
- **Documentation Standards**: Include overview and troubleshooting for each context

#### Context File Standards
```markdown
# Context File Template
## Purpose
Clear statement of what this context provides

## Core Knowledge
Essential domain information and concepts

## Operational Guidance
How to apply this knowledge effectively

## Best Practices
Proven patterns and approaches

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and resolution strategies
```

#### Context Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep contexts current with system changes
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure accuracy and relevance
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Maintain proper linking between contexts
- **Version Synchronization**: Update related contexts together

### Agent Context References

#### Dynamic Context Resolution
```markdown
## Extended Context Reference:
Reference context locations based on installation:
- Check if `./.claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/<category>/overview.md` exists first
- If not found, reference `~/.claude/agents/claudio/extended_context/<category>/overview.md`
- Use whichever location is available
```

#### Context Integration Patterns
- **Hierarchical Access**: General → Specific context progression
- **Cross-Domain References**: Link related contexts across categories
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of missing contexts
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient context loading and caching
