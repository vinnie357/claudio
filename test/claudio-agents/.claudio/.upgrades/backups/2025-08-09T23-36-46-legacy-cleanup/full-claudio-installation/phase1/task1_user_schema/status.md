**Dependencies**: All dependencies satisfied (Phoenix app with Ecto configured)

## Implementation Progress
### Not Started
- User migration creation
- User schema module
- Factory implementation
- Seeding scripts
- Testing setup

## Technical Decisions
(To be documented as implementation progresses)

## Issues and Notes
- Need to verify current database setup in existing Phoenix app
- Should align with existing app's user-facing patterns
- Consider impact on existing task management features

## Next Steps
1. Review existing Phoenix app structure and conventions
2. Generate user authentication scaffolding using `mix phx.gen.auth`
3. Customize generated code to match app requirements
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Implement database seeding for development

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria must be met and verified through:
- Successful migration execution
- Passing test suite
- Code review approval
- Integration testing with existing app structure

## Dependencies for Next Tasks
Upon completion, this task enables:
- **Task 2**: Authentication Context Module (immediate start)
- **Task 3**: Registration UI (can reference schema)
- **Task 4**: Session Management (needs user model)
