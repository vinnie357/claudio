## Dependency Management

All TaskFlow agents are designed to:
- Check for extended context availability before using advanced patterns
- Fallback to built-in TaskFlow knowledge when extended context is not available
- Gracefully handle missing context with research-specialist integration
- Work independently while benefiting from extended context when present

This TaskFlow agent configuration provides comprehensive mobile-first productivity application development support with specialized React Native, microservices, and AI integration capabilities.
