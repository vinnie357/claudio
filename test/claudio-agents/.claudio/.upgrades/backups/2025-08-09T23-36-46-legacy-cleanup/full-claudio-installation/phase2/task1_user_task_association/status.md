# Task 2.1 Status: User-Task Database Association

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 2.1
- **Task Name**: User-Task Database Association
- **Phase**: Phase 2 - Authorization Integration
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 day
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Started**: [Waiting for Phase 1 completion]
- **Last Updated**: [Initial status]
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
- **Required**: Phase 1 (Authentication Foundation) complete
- **Status**: Waiting for Phase 1 completion
- **Blockers**: Cannot begin until user authentication system is fully functional

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] Database migration adds user_id to tasks table
- [ ] Task schema updated with user association
- [ ] User schema updated with task association
- [ ] Data migration for existing tasks handled
- [ ] Task factories updated with user associations
- [ ] Database constraints ensure referential integrity
- [ ] Existing task functionality preserved
- [ ] Migration rollback capability tested

## Implementation Plan
### Phase A: Migration Planning and Preparation (0.3 days)
- [ ] Review existing task schema and data
- [ ] Plan data migration strategy for existing tasks
- [ ] Create migration file with proper constraints
- [ ] Test migration on development database copy

### Phase B: Schema Implementation (0.4 days)
- [ ] Execute database migration
- [ ] Update Task and User schema files
- [ ] Create database indexes for performance
- [ ] Update test factories and support files

### Phase C: Validation and Testing (0.3 days)
- [ ] Test user-task associations
- [ ] Validate existing task data integrity
- [ ] Test migration rollback
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing

## Technical Decisions
(To be documented as implementation progresses)

### Data Migration Strategy
- Approach for existing tasks: TBD (system user vs. nullable vs. admin assignment)
- Constraint handling: TBD (immediate vs. deferred)
- Performance optimization: TBD (index strategy)

## Current Work
**Status**: Ready to begin after Phase 1 completion
**Preparation**: Can review existing task schema and plan migration approach

## Data Migration Planning
### Existing Task Handling Options
1. **System User**: Create dedicated user for existing tasks
2. **Nullable Association**: Allow tasks without users initially
3. **Admin Assignment**: Assign to first admin/system user

### Risk Assessment
- Data loss risk: Low (migration preserves all data)
- Performance impact: Medium (need proper indexing)
- Rollback complexity: Medium (foreign key constraints)

## Issues and Blockers
- **Phase 1 Dependency**: Cannot proceed until authentication complete
- **Data Strategy Decision**: Need to choose approach for existing tasks
- **Testing Requirements**: Need production-like data copy for testing

## Next Steps (after Phase 1 completion)
1. Review completed authentication system and user schema
2. Analyze existing task data and choose migration strategy
3. Create and test database migration
4. Update schema files and associations
5. Update test infrastructure with new associations

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Migration tested successfully (up and down)
- [ ] All existing tasks preserved and accessible
- [ ] Database constraints working correctly
- [ ] Performance impact within acceptable limits
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Rollback procedure validated

## Testing Strategy
- Migration testing on database copy
- Association testing (user.tasks, task.user)
- Constraint violation testing
- Performance testing with realistic data size
- Integration testing with existing task operations
- Rollback testing

## Data Integrity Requirements
- Zero data loss during migration
- All existing tasks remain accessible
- Foreign key constraints properly enforced
- Database performance maintained or improved
- Referential integrity guaranteed

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria met and:
- Migration executed successfully
- All existing functionality preserved
- Database performance validated
- Integration testing passed
- Ready for Phase 2 Task 2 (Access Control)

## Dependencies for Next Tasks
Upon completion, enables:
- **Task 2**: Access Control Implementation (needs user-task associations)
- **Task 3**: Controller Updates (can reference task ownership)
- Foundation for all user-based task authorization
