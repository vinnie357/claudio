# Task 1.2 Status: Authentication Context Module

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: 1.2
- **Task Name**: Authentication Context Module
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Authentication Foundation
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1.5 days
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Started**: [Waiting for Task 1 completion]
- **Last Updated**: [Initial status]
- **Completion**: 0%

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: Task 1 (User Schema) must be completed
- **Status**: Waiting for user schema and migration
- **Blocker**: Cannot begin until database schema is established

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [ ] Authentication context module created
- [ ] User registration function implemented
- [ ] Login validation with password verification
- [ ] Password hashing utilities using bcrypt
- [ ] User lookup and authentication functions
- [ ] Password reset functionality foundation
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Integration with existing app patterns

## Implementation Plan
### Phase A: Core Infrastructure (0.5 days)
- [ ] Create Accounts context module structure
- [ ] Set up bcrypt dependency and configuration
- [ ] Establish testing framework

### Phase B: Authentication Functions (0.5 days)
- [ ] Implement user registration logic
- [ ] Create login validation functions
- [ ] Add password hashing utilities

### Phase C: Integration and Testing (0.5 days)
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform security review
- [ ] Validate integration with User schema
- [ ] Performance testing

## Technical Decisions
(To be documented as implementation progresses)

### Security Configuration
- Bcrypt rounds: TBD (minimum 12, optimize for performance)
- Password requirements: TBD (length, complexity)
- Rate limiting strategy: TBD

## Current Work
**Status**: Ready to begin after Task 1 completion
**Preparation**: Can review Phoenix authentication patterns and bcrypt documentation

## Issues and Notes
- Need to coordinate with existing app context patterns
- Must ensure security best practices throughout
- Consider future authorization requirements in design

## Next Steps (after Task 1 completion)
1. Review completed User schema structure
2. Set up Accounts context following Phoenix conventions
3. Implement core authentication functions
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Perform security review and testing

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (target >90% coverage)
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Integration tested with existing app

## Completion Criteria
All acceptance criteria met and:
- Security assessment passed
- Performance requirements validated
- Integration testing successful
- Documentation complete

## Dependencies for Next Tasks
Upon completion, enables:
- **Task 3**: Registration and Login UI (needs auth functions)
- **Task 4**: Session Management (needs authentication context)
- **Phase 2**: Task-user authorization integration
