# Task 1.3: Local Storage Integration Status

## Overview
- **Task**: 1.3 - Local Storage Integration
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup  
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days
- **Current Status**: Not Started

## Progress Tracking
- **Start Date**: TBD
- **Target Completion**: TBD
- **Actual Completion**: TBD  
- **Completion Percentage**: 0%

## Implementation Checklist
### Not Started ‚è∏
- [ ] Create JavaScript hook for theme storage operations
- [ ] Register hook in Phoenix LiveView application
- [ ] Add hook element to LiveView template
- [ ] Implement theme loading on mount event handler
- [ ] Implement theme saving event handler in LiveView
- [ ] Add error handling for localStorage unavailability
- [ ] Write integration tests for hook communication
- [ ] Test browser compatibility and storage scenarios

## Technical Details
### Files to Create/Modify
- `assets/js/hooks/theme_storage_hook.js` - Main storage hook (to create)
- `assets/js/app.js` - Register hook with LiveView (to update)
- `lib/task_app_web/live/task_live/index.ex` - Add event handlers (to update)
- `test/task_app_web/live/theme_storage_test.exs` - Integration tests (to create)

### Storage Specifications
- **Storage Key**: `'theme-preference'`
- **Valid Values**: `'light'`, `'dark'`, `'auto'`
- **Hook Name**: `ThemeStorage`
- **Error Strategy**: Graceful degradation with console warnings

## Dependencies
### Prerequisites
- [x] Browser localStorage API available
- [ ] Task 1.1 event handling structure (minimal dependency)
- [x] Phoenix LiveView hook system available

### Blocking Issues
- None currently identified - can proceed in parallel with Task 1.2

## Storage Integration Points
### Events to Handle
- `theme_loaded` - Sent from hook to LiveView on mount
- `theme_save` - Sent from LiveView to hook on theme change

### Error Scenarios
- localStorage quota exceeded
- localStorage disabled by user/browser policy
- Corrupted or invalid stored data
- Browser security restrictions (private browsing)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Error handling tested for all scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance requirements met (<10ms operations)
- [ ] No user-visible errors during storage failures

## Technical Decisions
- Using Phoenix LiveView hooks for clean integration
- Storing plain string values for simplicity
- Implementing graceful degradation instead of error throwing
- Console logging for debugging without user disruption

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for hook storage operations
- Integration tests for LiveView communication
- Browser compatibility testing across major browsers
- Error scenario testing (storage unavailable/full)

## Next Actions
1. Can begin immediately as minimal dependency on Task 1.1
2. Create JavaScript hook with storage operations
3. Set up basic LiveView integration structure
4. Test storage functionality independently

## Coordination Notes
- Can proceed in parallel with Task 1.2 (Theme Toggle)
- Integration testing will require Task 1.1 completion
- Will need coordination with Task 1.2 for full theme persistence testing
