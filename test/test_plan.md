# Comprehensive Claudio Core Workflow Testing Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive testing strategy for validating our enhanced Claudio architecture across all critical workflows. The plan focuses on ensuring our new validation patterns, dynamic extended_context creation, and parallel execution optimizations work correctly.

## Enhanced Architecture Patterns to Validate

Our testing must verify these key architectural enhancements:

### 1. Enhanced Validation Architecture
- **install-validation-coordinator** orchestrates 5 specialized validators
- **Parallel validation execution** for 5x faster validation
- **Specialized analysis** from each validator (dependencies, integration, mode, content, command-agent)

### 2. Dynamic Extended Context Creation
- **Agent-driven creation**: Only categories referenced by installed agents (2-6 typical)
- **No unused directories**: Elimination of comprehensive directory creation regardless of usage
- **Index-aware dependencies**: Uses `index.md` for agent-context mappings

### 3. Mode-Specific Validation
- **Commands-only**: Different requirements vs full workflow
- **User mode**: Generic templates vs project-specific customization
- **Installation paths**: Correct validation per target location

### 4. Parallel Execution Optimization
- **Multiple Task invocations in single message** patterns
- **Performance improvements**: 3-4x faster than sequential execution
- **Error isolation**: Individual failures don't block parallel operations

## Test Execution Sequence

Execute tests in this dependency order to validate the entire system:

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing - Commands-Only Installation
**Purpose**: Validate enhanced validation with minimal complexity

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_install_commands_test.md"
```

**Expected Enhanced Validation**:
- ✅ Install-validation-coordinator orchestrates 5 specialized validators in parallel
- ✅ Extended context categories: 2-4 created dynamically based on installed agents
- ✅ Index-aware validation confirms agent-context dependencies satisfied
- ✅ Mode-specific validation applies commands-only requirements (no workflow docs)
- ✅ No unused extended_context directories created
- ✅ Specialized analysis from each validator (dependencies, integration, mode, content, command-agent)

### Phase 2: Complete Installation Testing - Full Workflow
**Purpose**: Validate enhanced validation with complete workflow generation

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_install_test.md"
```

**Expected Enhanced Validation**:
- ✅ All 5 validation specialists run in parallel successfully
- ✅ Extended context categories: 4-6 created based on installed agents (not fixed 7)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation report from specialized validators
- ✅ Full workflow documents validated alongside enhanced installation validation
- ✅ Index mappings drive validation decisions correctly
- ✅ Mode-specific validation for full workflow requirements

### Phase 3: Complete Analysis Workflow Testing
**Purpose**: Test the most complex workflow with 15+ subagents in parallel batches

⚠️ **MISSING**: Need to create `test/claudio_claudio_test.md`

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_claudio_test.md"
```

**Expected Parallel Batch Execution**:
- ✅ Phase 2a: Discovery (sequential foundation)
- ✅ Phase 2b: Core workflow (parallel: PRD, plan, task)
- ✅ Phase 2c: Documentation & quality (parallel: docs, quality, tests)  
- ✅ Phase 2d: Security & analysis (parallel: security, design, research)
- ✅ Phase 2e: Structure integration (sequential)
- ✅ Phase 2f: Claude SDK analysis (optional parallel)
- ✅ Phase 2g: Workflow validation (mandatory final validation)

**Expected Validation Integration**:
- ✅ Enhanced validation architecture used throughout analysis
- ✅ Dynamic extended_context aligns with analysis agents used
- ✅ Index-aware validation throughout complex workflow

### Phase 4: Upgrade System Testing
**Purpose**: Test specialized upgrade coordination with parallel batches

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "@test/claudio_upgrade_test.md"
```

**Expected Parallel Coordination**:
- ✅ 6 specialized upgrade subagents coordinate correctly
- ✅ Parallel batch execution: (analysis + backup), then (localization + validation)
- ✅ Extended context alignment validated for upgraded agents
- ✅ Performance optimization through parallel execution demonstrated
- ✅ Enhanced validation patterns applied to upgrade process

## Critical Success Criteria

### Enhanced Validation System Success
- **Coordinator Orchestration**: Install-validation-coordinator successfully manages 5 specialists
- **Parallel Performance**: 5 validators complete faster than sequential validation would
- **Specialized Analysis**: Each validator provides focused, expert analysis in their domain
- **Integration Quality**: Validation results aggregate into comprehensive installation reports

### Dynamic Extended Context Success
- **Agent-Driven Creation**: Only extended_context categories referenced by installed agents are created
- **Category Count Validation**: 2-6 categories typically (not fixed 7)  
- **Index Compliance**: Extended context creation follows agent dependency mappings in index.md
- **Efficiency**: No unused directories created, reducing installation bloat

### Parallel Execution Success
- **Multiple Task Invocations**: "Run multiple Task invocations in SINGLE message" patterns work
- **Performance Improvement**: Parallel batches complete 3-4x faster than sequential
- **Error Isolation**: Individual agent failures don't block parallel operations
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient memory and CPU usage during concurrent operations

### System Integration Success
- **Cross-Workflow Consistency**: All workflows use enhanced validation architecture
- **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Validation adapts correctly to installation mode
- **Index-Aware Operations**: System decisions driven by index mappings
- **Quality Assurance**: Specialized validators catch issues basic validation would miss
